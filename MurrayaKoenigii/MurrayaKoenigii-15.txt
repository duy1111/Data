Abstract

The all the traditional system of medicines are included in the account of AYUSH. The AYUSH department included the following system of medicines Ayurvedic, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH). These systems help us to eradicate or help in to overcome the problems related to the allopathic medicines such as side effect, drug resistance and adverse effect of the drug. Due to all these reasons the plant source for medicinal purpose are highly prefer. This review article describes the medicinal importance of the medicinal plant Murraya koenigii. The therapeutic value of Murraya koenigii extract for the various diseases with its other pharmacognostic features such as morphology, growth constraints, biochemical composition and biological activities. This review contains the description of Murraya koenigii with its pharmacological activities of isolated compounds and bioactivity of extract on different animal models in various laboratories. In addition to that, it highlights its potential to have a various type of pharmacological activity.

Introduction

India is frequently known by enormous biodiversity of medicinal plants. Among them Murraya koenigii have a lots of bioactive principles due to which plant has been proven as the medicinally important plant but least or no attention received by the scientist. Murraya koenigii is proven as the natural medicinal plant. There are different forms of Murraya koenigii due to which they are found as the useful plant such as extract, essential oil, or directly used due to the presence of following active constituent bismahanine, murrayanine, murrayafoline-A, bi-koeniquinone-A, bismurrayaquinone, mukoenine-A, mukoenine-B, mukoenine-C, murrastifoline, Murrayazolinol, murrayacine, murrayazolidine, murrayazoline, mahanimbine, girinimbine, koenioline, xynthyletin, koenigine-Quinone A and koenigine-Quinone B for therapeutic purpose by folk people. Many medicines such as digitalis, vinblastine, aspirin and quinine has plant as a source of origin for example foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), willow bark (Salix spp.), quinine bark (Cinchona officinalis). For therapeutic or prophylactic purposes medicinal plant are used. For the therapeutic properties of medicinal plants presence of secondary metabolites plays a very important role such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpinoids, vitamins, tannins etc., these all are the secondary metabolites of the plant as active constituent. These all secondary metabolites of plant physiologically affect the body at different stages of body development and make the body disease free. The plant Murraya koenigii belonging to the family Rutaceae is largely growing plant throughout the spring, summer and in rain fall season in every part of the tropical region up to the height of 1500 to 1655m from sea level. It is also known as Curry Leaf English, Mitha Neem in Hindi, and Karuveppilei in Tamilnadu and Surabhinimba in Sanskrit.

History

The history of curry leaves are seen in early 1 to 4 century AD. In Tamil and Kannada literature it was updated as word ‘kari’ with its uses. The word now popularly used for the Murraya koenigii is curry leaf which is originated from Tamil word Kari which means as ‘spiced sauce’. In the early literatures of Tamil and Kannada the use of Murraya koenigii is described as the flavouring agent for the vegetables. Today Murraya koenigii are grown as the cultivated crop in India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Australia, Pacific Islands and Africa as flavouring agent for the food.

Distribution

Murraya koenigii originates from east and south part of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, China and Hainan but widely cultivated in South-East Asia and some parts of the United States and Australia. It grows throughout India up to the height of 1500 to 1655m from sea level and in the Andaman Islands. It is also available in other part of Asian region like in moist forests of 500-1600m height in Guangdong, Shainan, S Yunnan (Xishuangbanna), Bhutan, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam. Together with South Indian immigrants, curry leaves reached Malaysia, South Africa and Reunion Island. Out of the 14 global species that belong to the genus Murraya, only two are known to be found in India, which is Murraya koenigii (Spreng) and Murraya paniculata (Jack). Can grow in full sun or light shade.Murraya koenigii is distributed from south and East Asia to Australia.
Growing season

Curry Leaf plant to have flowers and vibrant green leaves throughout the spring, summer and in rain fall. The leaves drop off during its’ resting period in the winter months. They like full sun, well-drained soil, which should be the dry side and they need fertilizer in the month of summer. The fruiting season was observed to continue from the end of June to the end of August, and the July is considered as the peak fruiting season. In India, harvesting of leaves started from 15 months after planting out and collection of leaves repeated in every 2 to 3 months. In cold countries such as in Southern California, South Texas and South Florida, outdoors growth needs protection from freezing. Seeds are fragile so handle with care.

Microscopy

The microscopically view of Murraya koenigii is as follow:

Leaves: The leaves have the obliquely ovate or fairly rhomboid with acuminate obtuse or acute apex. The petiole is about 20 to 30cm in length and the leaves have reticulate venation and dentate margin with an asymmetrical base. In the microscopic studies, it was elucidate that the stomata were distributed on adaxial surface and the adaxial surface does not have stomata and the type of stomata that was found is anomocytic. The transverse section of the leaves has a layer of epidermis which is composed of rectangular cell. The upper epidermis was covered with cuticle and in the midrib the epidermis has 1 to 4 layers of collenchymatous hypodermis with 2-5 layers of chlorenchyma cells. The ground tissue is oval to polygonal parenchyma cell with vascular bundle. Calcium oxalate found in sandy and prismatic crystals. The curry leaf shows the presence of unicellular trichomes with obliterated lumen, parenchymatous pith in petiole, long pericyclic fibre in the midrib, large cruciferous stomata and prismatic calcium oxalate crystals.

Extraction methods for active chemical constituent

Many methods are available for the preparation of the extract in which some methods are as follow:

- Murraya koenigii powder was extracted with 100ml of Ethanol and kept on rotary shaker at 190-220 rpm for 24 hours. The extract was collected and solvent was evaporated to make the final volume and stored at 40C in air tight bottles.

- Extractions and separations on the isolates of hexane, chloroform and methanol of the plant samples (stem bark and roots) have led to the isolation and characterizations of carbazole alkaloids. Stem barks and roots of Murraya koenigii extracts was concentrated to yield a brown yellowish viscous syrup for crude hexane extract (22.5g and 33.0g) and dark brown viscous syrup for crude chloroform extract (14.0g and 24.0g). Each crude extracts was subjected to column vacuum chromatography over silica gel and eluted with mixture of hexane, hexane/ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate/ methanol and methanol to give a total about 75 fractions each.
- The crude powder of Murraya koenigii leaves was defatted with petroleum ether for about 24h. After defattation, the extraction was carried out using a Soxhlet apparatus in hydro-methanolic solution in the ratio 30:70.
