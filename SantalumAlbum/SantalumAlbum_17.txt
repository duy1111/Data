Santalum Album - Traditional Chinese Medicine

A system of medicine dating back over 23 centuries, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to prevent and heal diseases and is considered one of the world’s oldest medical systems. Known as Tan Xiang, sandalwood has been a part of TCM practices for thousands of years however, according to the Chinese Pharmacopeia, only Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) is permissible for use in formulations.

Sandalwood is used for conditions such as skin diseases, acne, dysentery, gonorrhoea, anxiety, cystitis, fatigue, frigidity, impotence, nervous tension, eczema, stomach-ache, vomiting and stress. Indian Sandalwood has also been found to be particularly effective in regulating Qi ﬂow (vital energy), warming to harmonise the stomach and to eliminate pain.6

Quintis offers a range of sustainable, certified, natural Indian sandalwood products. Typically, logs are purchased whole and TCM practitioners create their own chips or powder to be added into blends or tea. We are proud to offer Indian sandalwood products which meet the strict Chinese Pharmacopeia standards for Traditional Chinese Medicine.
