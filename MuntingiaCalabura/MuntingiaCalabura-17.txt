Medicinal properties of Muntingia calabura L.: A Review

ABSTRACT:
Indonesia has abundant medicinal plants, which have been historically used by the population in treating
diseases for generations. Traditional Indonesian medicine and the medicinal plants used could lead to the
discovery of novel drugs. For example, Muntingia calabura L., also known as kersen, is a well-known medicinal
plant that has been used to treat various diseases worldwide. The pharmacological activities and phytochemical
composition of the whole plant of M. calabura L. have been investigated and identified by scientists in recent
decades. These studies have established the therapeutic potential of kersen for drug discovery. This present
review provides an overview of the ethnopharmacology, pharmacology, and phytochemistry of M. calabura L.
as they relate to its use against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

INTRODUCTION:
Indonesia has rich sources of natural medicines and traditional medicine preparations that have been used by most of the population for generations1,2,3. A direct advantage of traditional medicine formulations to the community is the ease of obtaining them4. The demand for plants used as traditional medicine formulations by the community is also increasing because plant-derived medicines have proven to be healthier and do not cause as many side effects as those derived from chemicals. However, a problem with traditional medicine formulations is the lack of adequate knowledge and information about the various types of plants commonly used as ingredients and their methods of use5.
