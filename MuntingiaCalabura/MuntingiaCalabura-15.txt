Strawberry Tree fruit will amaze you with it's fantastic flavor - a combination of buttered popcorn and cotton candy! It's a small to medium-sized fast-growing tropical to subtropical fruit tree/shrub with small white flowers that resemble those of a strawberry plant.  It produces tons of red bite-size edible berries that resemble cherries and ripen quickly. Muntingia's fruit is beloved by birds and squirrels but don't worry, since it fruits so prolifically almost all year long, there’s more than enough fruit for everyone to enjoy abundantly. 

You will not find this rare fruit at market even in its native range due to short shelf life so picking it off the tree and eating it fresh is a must if you want to experience this wholesome and exotic flavor.
