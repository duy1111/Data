Anti-inflammatory Activity of Muntingia calabura Fruits

Muntingia calabura, the sole species in the genus Muntingia, is a flowering plant, that belongs to Elaeocarpaceae family. This is a fast growing fruit tree. It is a pioneer species that thrives in poor soil, able to tolerate acidic and alkaline conditions and drought. The fruits are commonly called Jamaican cherry and are red in colour. The flowers are used as an antiseptic and to treat abdominal cramps and spasms. It is also taken to relieve headaches and colds. Muntingia calabura fruits possess antioxidant property. However, their anti-inflammatory activity has not been investigated so far. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity from the fruits of M. calabura. The methanolic fruit extracts (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the Carrageenan-induced edema of the hind paw of adult male Wistar Albino rats in 3 hours. The activity was compared with that of the standard drug indomethacin. Acute toxicity was investigated and the results indicated no abnormalities in the behaviour and lethality by the extract up to 1000 mg/kg. These results indicate the fruit extract of M. calabura possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, these pharmacological results clearly support traditional folkloric application of M. calabura fruits in the control and/or pain, inflammatory illness as well as an antioxidant agent.
