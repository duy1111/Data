5.7.4 Ocimum Sanctum
Ocimum sanctum (OS) is also known as Holy Basil or Tulsi, and belongs to the family of Lamiaceae. This plant is well known for its medicinal and spiritual properties in Ayurveda which includes aiding cough, asthma, diarrhea, fever, dysentery, arthritis, eye diseases, indigestion, gastric ailments, etc. Major phytoconstituents of OS are eugenol, ursolic acid, rosmarinic acid, apigenin, myretenal, luteolin, β-sitosterol, and carnosic acid (Pattanayak et al., 2010).

Several researchers have demonstrated the medicinal and therapeutic potential of OS extract in in vitro and in vivo models. The antioxidant activity of OS was evaluated by Subramanian et al. (2005) which showed free radical scavenging, antilipid peroxidation, and superoxide radical scavenging properties of the extract. Researchers investigated the reduced level of uric acid by the administration of OS extract, which is the most important causing factor of arthritis. Further the extract also exhibited significant antiinflammatory activity evaluated by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 (Kelm et al., 2000). Emerging evidences reported the protective effect of OS extract against radiation-induced chromosomal damage in mice due to its free radical scavenging and metal-chelating properties (Uma Devi et al., 2000). In addition studies also have observed the radiation-induced protection of OS against bone marrow damage by using the plant extract.

OS extracts show that antistress activity was evaluated by the reduced level of cortisol release and CHHR1 receptor activity using in vitro studies. Further, the antistress activity of the OS extract has been well demonstrated by the significantly lower levels of cortisone and creatine kinase in acute stress-induced rats as compared to the normal group (Gupta et al., 2007). Further literature also indicates that pretreatment with OS extract decreased the stomach ulcer index and plasma corticosterone in 4-hour restraint stress. Enhancing physical performance activity of OS extract was evaluated by several researchers in different animal models which showed enhanced aerobic metabolism, increased swimming duration and latency and attenuation of oxidative tissue damage leading to normalization of several physiological and biochemical parameters caused by physical stressors. Further, OS extract protected the animals from acute and chronic noise-induced stress in experimental animals by increasing neurotransmitter and ECG responses (Richard et al., 2016).

1.3.4 Ocimum sanctum (family: Lamilaceae, common name: tulsi)
Ocimum sanctum, popularly known as holy basil, is arguably one of the most important plants in India. It is of both religious and medicinal value and is found to grow well in moist soil. Pharmacological studies have shown that the plant possesses antifertility, anticancer, antidiabetic, antifungal, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, antiemetic, antispasmodic, analgesic, adaptogenic, diaphoretic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Eugenol (1-hydroxy-2-methoxy-4-allylbenzene), an important constituent present, is believed to be responsible for its myriad therapeutic properties, including antiarthritic effects. Additionally, linolenic acid, a constituent of tulsi oil, is also shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity (Singh, 1998).

Ocimum sanctum
Ocimum sanctum (family Lamiaceae), commonly known as Holy Basel or Tulsi, is an annual herb that has been used in the Indian traditional system of medicine for hundreds of years. The leaves of this plant have been traditionally used in coughs, colds, asthma, and bronchitis (Ghosh, 1995). A steam-distilled extract of O. sanctum leaves provided a reduction in antigen-induced histamine release from peritoneal MCs (Mediratta et al., 1988).

Experimental animal studies showed the immunomodulatory potential of O. sanctum seed oil and an extract of leaves (Godhwani et al., 1988; Mediratta et al., 2002). Another study showed that ethanolic extract of fresh leaves and fixed oil from seeds protected against histamine and acetylcholine-induced proconvulsive dyspnea (suggestive of an antiasthmatic effect), and an antiinflammatory effect against carrageenan, serotonin, histamine, and PGE2-induced inflammation. The antiasthmatic effect was attributed to the volatile oils present in the extract. However, extracts of dried leaves did not show any protective effects in the above experimental model of bronchoconstriction, indicating the disappearance of activity during the drying process (Gupta et al., 2002). Hydroalcoholic extract of Ocimum basilicum showed decreased IL-4, IgE, PLA2, and total protein (TP) levels in ovalbumin-induced model of asthma in rats (Eftekhar et al., 2019). All pathological lungs indicated significantly increased interferon (IFN)-γ/IL-4 ratio and improved lung pathology, suggesting immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory effects compared to controls.

15.3.10 Ocimum sanctum L.
Ocimum sanctum L. (Tulsi) is one such medicinal plant having numerous medicinal properties [67, 68]. The medicinal uses of Tulsi are well documented and extensively used in the traditional Indian systems of medicine for treating various diseases either alone or in combination with other herbal plants [69]. Tulsi has been used for thousands of years for its diverse healing properties and regarded in Ayurveda as the “elixir of life” that promotes longevity [70].

A methanol extract (500 mg/kg) and an aqueous suspension of O. sanctum are known to have analgesic, antipyretic, and antiinflammatory effects in acute and chronic inflammation in rats. The fixed oil and linolenic acid possess significant antiinflammatory activity against prostaglandin E2, leukotriene, and arachidonic acid by virtue of their capacity to block both the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism [71].

Experimental studies of Tulsi have shown to inhibit acute and chronic inflammation in rats. This test conducted by carrageenan-induced paw edema, croton oil-induced granuloma, and exudates at a dose of 500 mg/kg, BW/day. The oils processed from fresh leaves and seeds of O. sanctum have revealed antiinflammatory effects on experimental animals induced by carrageenan, histamine, serotonin, and prostaglandin E2, according to some studies. These experimental rats administered with essential oil (200 mg/kg, BW, and fixed oil (0.1 mL/kg, bw) before the injection of phlogistic agents and compared with standard drug flurbiprofen. It noted that Tulsi extracts could significantly reduce the edema when compared with the saline-treated control [72].

Holy basil and Alzheimer’s: O. sanctum ameliorates H2O2 induced neuronal damage via its antioxidant defense mechanism and might be used to treat oxidative stress mediated neuronal disorders. Its extract restored matrix metalloproteinases and superoxide dismutase, CAT enzyme/protein levels and also inhibited HSP-70 overexpression.

•
Holy basil and diabetes. O. sanctum prevents diabetes and diabetic complications through its antioxidant activity by reducing the plasma level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and maintain the antioxidant markers like catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase. The antidiabetic effect resulting in lowering of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid peroxide, FFA has been attributed to its effect in stimulating insulin secretion (Hannan etal.,2006; Husain etal.,2015).

Tulsi is revered by the Indian Hindus and has immense ceremonial value. It enjoys the pride of place among all accessories required for all religious, family, and community functions like marriage, Puja (religious festivals), and Sraddha ceremony (religious function performed after cremation). The antiquity of the use of Tulsi in these practices is authenticated in the ancient Indian scriptures and is still followed throughout India (Gupta et al., 2002).

Phytochemical studies have shown that oleanolic acid, ursolic acid (Figure 21.2), rosmarinic acid, eugenol (Figure 21.2), carvacrol, linalool, and β-caryophyllene are some of the main chemical constituents of Tulsi. Tulsi also contains eugenol methyl ester, caryophyllene, terpinene-4-ol, (+)-δ-cadinene, 3-carene, α-humulene, citral, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-camphor, carvacrol, luteolin, methyl chavicol, limatrol, decyladehyde, cirsilineol, cirsimaritin, isothymusin, isothymonin, apigenin, and rosmarinic acid (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). On distillation, Tulsi yields pale yellow colored oil, and the leaves contain the highest percentage of oil. The oil is rich in eugenol, which is one of the major active phytochemicals and possesses myriad benefits (Gupta et al., 2002).

Indian Medicinal Plants with Hypoglycemic Potential
P.K. Mukherjee, ... K. Mukherjee, in Bioactive Food as Dietary Interventions for Diabetes, 2013

2.26.1 Ocimum sanctum L
It is commonly known as ‘Holy Basil’ distributed throughout India. It is thought that the plant exhibits hypoglycemic effect mediated by its cortisol-inhibiting potency and the plant may be used effectively in regulating corticosteroid-induced DM. The 70% ethanolic leaf extracts showed hypoglycemic activity in normal, glucose-fed, and STZ diabetic rats orally, and potentiated the action of exogenous insulin in normal rats. Plasma glucose-lowering activity of plant extract (200 mg kg−1 for 30 days) in STZ-induced diabetic animals revealed the effect of the extract on three important enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, namely glucokinase, hexokinase, and phosphofructokinase (Vats et al., 2002).

Indian Medicinal Plants as Immunomodulators
H. Bhat, ... R. Fayad, in Bioactive Food as Dietary Interventions for Arthritis and Related Inflammatory Diseases, 2013

2.1 Ocimum sanctum Linn. or Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Family Lamiaceae)
Ocimun sanctum commonly known as Tulsi in Hindi and Holy basil in English is a very important plant in India and is used extensively in Ayurveda. Reports have suggested the presence of antipyretic, antistress, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and other beneficial properties (Mediratta et al., 2002, 2008). Preclinical studies with non-stressed and stressed (deprived of food and water) animals have shown that tulsi oil was effective as an immunomodulator in both non-stressed and stressed rats. The administration of tulsi oil (3 ml kg− 1) intraperitoneally to normal animals produced a significant increase in anti-sheep red blood cells antibody titer and concomitantly decreased the histamine release from peritoneal mast cells of sensitized rats indicating the triggering of a humoral immune responses (Mediratta et al., 2002). The oil was also effective in decreasing the footpad thickness and the percentage of leukocyte migration inhibition, suggesting the induction of a cell-mediated immune response (Mediratta et al., 2002).

Additional experiments have shown that pretreatment with the oil effectively suppressed humoral as well as cell-mediated responses in retained animals. The oil was effective when combined with diazepam (an anxiolytic-sedative drug) suggesting its usefulness as an adjuvant to the conventional agent. Mechanistic studies showed that the immunomodulatory effects of the oil were negated when the animals were administered with flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist confirming the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic pathways in mediating these beneficial effects (Mediratta et al., 2002). Experiments with rats have also shown that the oil was effective in attenuating the immunotoxic effects of lindane. Mechanistic studies indicated that these beneficial effects were mediated through the immune modulation of cells of the humoral and cellular immune responses and ameliorating the oxidative stress (Mediratta et al., 2008).
