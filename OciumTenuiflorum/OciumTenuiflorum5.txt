Description
Holy basil is an aromatic annual or short-lived pernnial or subshrub in the Lamiaceae (mint) family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southern Asia. The genus name comes from the Greek word okimon which means aromatic herb.

While holy basil is a close relative of culinary basil, its leaves tend to have a purple cast, its flowers are not as large, and it is shorter-lived.  This erect multistemmed subshrub grows rapidly to a height of 3 feet and easily propagates itself by seed.

It prefers full sun in moist, well drained soil.  While it tolerates a wide variety of soil types and pH conditions it does poorly in water logged soils.  

Plant it in a sensory or herb garden to enjoy its spicy fragrance but place it in a confined area or container to manage its spread.

Insects, Diseases, and Other Plant Problems:  Japanese beetles can skeletonize and defoliate leaves.  Remove them by hand. It can be considered an aggressive weed in regions outside its native range.
