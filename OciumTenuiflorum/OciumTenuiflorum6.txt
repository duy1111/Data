The holy basil plant is revered in Hinduism as a manifestation of the goddess Lakshmi (Tulsi), the principal consort of the god Vishnu. The plant is especially sacred to Vaishnavites (devotees of Vishnu), and the Lord Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, is said to wear a garland of holy basil leaves and flowers around his neck. The plant is grown in many Hindu homes, often in the courtyard in a dedicated four-sided structure, and the presence of a holy basil plant is believed to increase piety, foster meditation, purify, and protect. Devotees commonly worship in the morning and evening with mantras and offerings of flowers, incense, or water from the Ganges, and Tuesdays and Fridays are considered especially sacred. Even the ritual act of watering and caring for the plant, usually undertaken by the women of the house, is considered worshipful and meritorious. Holy basil is cultivated at many temples, and the woody stems of plants that have died are used to make beads for sacred japa mala (rosaries). The beginning of the Hindu wedding season is marked by a festival known as Tulsi Vivah, in which homes and temples ceremonially wed holy basil to Vishnu. Water infused with the leaves is often given to the dying to help elevate their souls, and funeral pyres are commonly fitted with holy basil twigs with the hopes that the deceased may obtain moksha and be liberated from the cycle of rebirth.
chervil, (Anthriscus cerefolium), annual herb of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). It is native to regions of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and to western Asia. Chervil is cultivated in Europe for its lacy, decompound, aromatic leaves, which are used to flavour fish, salads, soups, eggs, meat dishes, and stuffings for poultry and fish. Herb mixtures such as the French fines herbes frequently contain chervil. Chervil has a delicate aroma and a taste reminiscent of anise. The essential oil occurs in a duct accompanying each of the veins in the leaflets and rachis (the axis of the leaflets). In some parts of Europe, chervil root is eaten as a vegetable.
