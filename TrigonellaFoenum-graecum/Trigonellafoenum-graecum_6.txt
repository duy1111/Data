Anti hyperglycemic and anti oxidative effect of aqueous extract of Momordica charantia pulp and Trigonella foenum graecum seed in alloxan induced diabetic rats 

Diabetes is an oxidative stress disorder and oxidative damage to tissues such as heart, kidney, liver and other organs may be a contributory factor to several diabetic complications. Momordica charantia (family: Cucurbitaceae) and Trigonella foenum graecum (family: Fabaceae) are used traditionally in Indian folk medicine to manage diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the anti hyperglycemic and anti oxidative potential of aqueous extracts of M. charantia pulp and seed powder of T. foenum graecum were assessed in alloxan (150 mg/kg body weight) induced diabetic rats. Alloxan treatment to the rats could induce diabetes as the fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were > 280 mg/dl. Treatment of diabetic rats for 30 days with M. charantia and T. foenum graecum could significantly (p < 0.001) improve the FBG levels to near normal glucose levels. Antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione content and glutathione s transferase) and lipid peroxidation levels were measured in heart, kidney and liver tissues of normal, diabetic and experimental animals (diabetics + treatment). TBARS levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher and anti oxidative activities were found low in diabetic group, as compared to the control group. Significant (p < 0.001) improvement in both the TBARS levels and antioxidant activities were observed when M. charantia and T. foenum graecum were given to diabetic rats. Our results clearly demonstrate that M. charantia and T. foenum graecum are not only useful in controlling the blood glucose levels, but also have antioxidant potential to protect vital organs such as heart and kidney against damage caused due to diabetes induced oxidative stress.
