Effect of Trigonella foenum-graecum seed powder on the antioxidant levels of high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin induced type II diabetic rats 

Background and objectives: Type II diabetes is a disease characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress. Among the natural products, Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek) is found to have many active bio molecules. It is used traditionally in Indian folk medicine to treat diabetes.
Materials and methods: In the present study, the antioxidative potential of Trigonella foenum-graecum seed powder was assessed in high fat diet and low dose streptozotocin (35 mg/kg body weight) induced type II diabetic rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used for the study. Lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant activities (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and reduced glutathione) were measured in pancreas and liver tissues of normal, diabetic and diabetic + Trigonella foenum-graecum treated rats. The diabetic + glibenclamide treated rats served as positive control.
Results: Treatment of diabetic rats with Trigonella foenum-graecum significantly (p < or = 0.001) improved the fasting blood glucose levels to near normal blood glucose levels. The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly higher and the activities of antioxidants were found to be lowered in diabetic rats, as compared to the normal rats. Improved activities of antioxidants and a significant decline in the levels of TBARS were observed in both Trigonella foenum-graecum treated and glibenclamide treated diabetic rats.
Conclusions: Trigonella foenum-graecum, apart from controlling the blood glucose levels, also has antioxidant potential to protect the organs such as liver and pancreas against the oxidative damage induced by diabetes.
