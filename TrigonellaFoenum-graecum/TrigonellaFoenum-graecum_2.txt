The T. foenum graecum cold water extract, known as fenugreek tea, has been traditionally used against respiratory infections (bronchitis and pneumonia), and since it nourishes the body during illness, the herb has also been used to reduce fever, when taken with lemon and honey. Trigonella foenum graecum has been shown to possess hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic activities (Micallef and Garg, 2009). Fenugreek also has a long history of use in the treatment of reproductive disorders, in inducing labor, treating hormonal disorders, increasing milk supply, and reducing menstrual pain. The plant has been known to have health potential with the ability to maintain blood glucose and cholesterol levels, and hence in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and heart disorders. Trigonella foenum graecum has also been reported to exhibit pharmacological properties including antiviral, antimicrobial, hypotensive, antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and antitumor activity (Mullaicharam et al., 2013). Al Oqail et al. (2013) demonstrated a decrease in the cell viability of cancerous cells exposed to seed oil of fenugreek.
