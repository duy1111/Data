EVALUATION OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-ARTHRITIC ACTIVITY OF ETHANOLIC EXTRACT OF LEAVES OF NYCTANTHES ARBOR-TRISTIS ON EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MODELS

Abstract :
BACKGROUND Inflammation is characterised by pain, redness, swelling and tenderness. Usually, conventional anti-inflammatory drugs are used to treat inflammation. But these drugs have side effects like acceleration of damage and erosion of joint spaces and advance osteoporosis. Traditionally, Nyctanthes arbor-tristis has been used to treat various diseases. So, the present study is undertaken to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activities of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis. Aim--The present study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti- arthritic activity of the ethanolic extracts of leaves of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis (EENA). The extract was prepared by percolation method and acute oral toxicity test was performed as per OECD guidelines. Objectives 1. To evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis against acute inflammation by Carrageenan induced rat paw oedema method. 2. To evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis against chronic inflammation by adjuvant arthritis method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Acute inflammation was studied by Carrageenan induced rat paw oedema method and paw volumes were measured at various intervals. Activity against chronic inflammation was studied by Freud's complete adjuvant induced arthritis method. Paw volumes were measured on 1st day, 5th day (injected paws) and on 21st day. Aspirin was taken as the standard drug for all the experiments and a control group was maintained in all the models. RESULTS EENA showed highly significant (p CONCLUSION Based on the findings, we can conclude that the ethanolic extract of leaves of Nyctanthes arbor-tristis contains anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity.
