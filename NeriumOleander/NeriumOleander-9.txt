Oleander
Nerium oleander
Also known as: Nerium
Nerium oleander, colloquially known as oleander, is a shrub or a small tree, known for its majestic pink five-lobed flowers and deep green lanceolate leaves. Oleander is one of the most poisonous popular decorative garden plants, so it is advised to keep small children and pets away from it.

Water
Oleander is a remarkably drought-tolerant plant. Young plants require regular watering until they become established, but mature plants should be watered infrequently and thoroughly. Although Oleander is drought-tolerant, it will perform best when properly watered. Let the soil dry out between waterings, then give it a good soak.

Fertilization
Oleander doesn't have any particular fertilization needs unless it shows signs of nutrient deficiencies. Test your soil for important nutrients and apply the fertilizer accordingly. On the other hand, plants grown in containers should be fertilized more often. In this case it might be best to apply a balanced, granular fertilizer once a month during the growing season.

Pruning
Shape the plant every 2 months during the growing season.
