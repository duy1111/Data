Negligible Oleandrin Content of Hot Dogs Cooked on Nerium oleander Skewers 

Abstract

Introduction: The Nerium oleander plant contains cardenolides that may cause human poisoning when ingested. A long-standing belief holds that it is possible to be poisoned by eating hot dogs or other foods cooked on Nerium oleander branch skewers. Oleandrin levels in frankfurters cooked on fresh and dry Nerium oleander skewers were measured.

Methods: Hot dogs were cooked separately on either dried or fresh oleander branch skewers using a disposable charcoal grill. The hot dogs were then frozen and transported to an analytical laboratory where oleandrin content was measured via liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS).

Results: The oleandrin content of hot dogs cooked on dried and fresh skewers did not exceed 343 ng and 701 ng, respectively.

Conclusion: Hot dogs cooked on Nerium oleander skewers contain a negligible amount of oleandrin with respect to that sufficient to cause human poisoning. Reports of poisonings occurring in this manner are most likely the result of an urban myth.
