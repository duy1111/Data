Syzygium jambos - Flower Of India
Syzygium jambos is an evergreen tree up to 10 m tall. The terminal inflorescence is showy and usually carries four whitish-green flowers on the outside of the crown. The leaves are lanceshaped, 2-4 cm broad, 10 cm to 20 cm long, pointed, base wedge-shaped with hardly any leaf-stalk, lively red when growing, but dark, glossy green on attaining full size. The showy flowers are in small clusters at branch-ends, white or greenish white, the long, numerous stamens giving them a diameter of 5-8 cm. The fruits are whitish-green, rose scented, about 5 cm long and ripen over an extended period. The edible fruit is shaped like a small pear. The flesh is a bit softer than that of an apple. It tastes like a cross between apple and watermelon, with a very mild rose scent and a slightly bitter aftertaste. In ancient Sanskrit, the land now called India was referred to by the ancient Indians themselves as Jambudvipa, which means Rose-apple-land (jambu = rose apple; dvipa = land). The dry, crisp fresh fruit is used to make jellies. Fruit/seed can be produced following self-pollination. Rose Apple is native to India, China and SE Asia.
