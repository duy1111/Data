Syzygium jambos L. Alston: An Insight Into its Phytochemistry, Traditional Uses, and Pharmacological Properties

by other organisms which facilitate their metabolisms. These
substances are provided from plants, microorganisms, or animals
with a pronounced interest since they constitute the main sources
of foods and thus, our first resort in case of pain (van Wyk and
Wink 2015).
Plants contain chemicals not essential for their metabolism
rather for the fight against attacks and stress due to the plant
habitats. These phytochemicals have shown distinct biological
properties against numbers of illnesses (Iwu, 1993; van Wyk and
Wink 2015). Both plants and compounds are of great interest in
drug development to face new medical challenges.
Accordingly, numerous of research works have been
conducted on plants from the genus Syzygium to elucidate its
chemistry and pharmacology. Species of this genus, including S.
jambos, offer edible fruits found under various formulation
including juices, jellies, and jams (Sun et al., 2020). The
decoction of these fruits serves to alleviate gastrointestinal
disorders, wounds, syphilis, leprosy, as well as toothache
(Chua et al., 2019). Reports have highlighted the occurrence of
polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, and sterols from various organs
of S. jambos species. Meanwhile, plant extracts and compounds
also claimed a broad spectrum of activities from antibacterial to
anti-inflammatory activities through analgesic, antiviral, anti-
dermatophyte, anticancer, and hepatoprotective properties
(Sobeh et al., 2018). Two recent reviews very briefly
highlighted the chemical composition, traditional uses and
biological activities of the plant (Harsha et al., 2021;
Subbulakshmi et al., 2021).
The present research survey tends to summarize the
traditional uses, chemical constituents, and pharmacological
properties of extracts and compounds from S. jambos in one
document as much information as possible about this plant,
which has many biological properties. This work could
provide a scientific basis for future study and necessary
information for further investigations of new drug discovery.
TAXONOMY AND BOTANICAL
DESCRIPTION
The genus Syzygium contains approximately 1,200–1800 species,
the majority of which are flowering plants (Khalaf et al., 2021). Its
taxonomy has been disputed for long with that of the genus
Eugenia (Mabberley, 2017). As a result, species of the later have
been ranged in the genus Syzygium. Amongst them, S.
malaccence, S. suborbiculare, S. paniculatum, S. aqueum,
samarangense, and S. jambos (Sobeh et al., 2016; Cock and
Cheesman, 2018). S. jambos L. Alston, synonym of Eugenia
jambos, is native to Reunion Island, Central America
(Guatemal), and South-East of Asia, especially in Nepal,
Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia. It has been naturalized
in India and claims various vernacular names in different cultures
including malabar plum, plum rose, rose apple, and water apple
(Maskey and Shah, 1982; Morton, 1987; Avila-Peña et al., 2007).
S. jambos belonging to the family Myrtaceae, is a medium
sized tree reaching 7.5–12 m in height, Figure 1 (Morton, 1987).
Due to its physical characteristics and the aroma of the fruits, the
plant is often known as rose apple. It has a dense crown of slender
with wide spreading branches. Leaves are opposite, lanceolate,
and glabrous with 2.5–6.25 cm wide and 10–22 cm length. They
are glossy and dark-green when mature while vibrant red when
young. Flowers are in small terminal clusters, white or greenish
white with a diameter of 5–10 cm. Usually, there are 4–5 flowers
together in terminal clusters (Nawwar et al., 2016). The berries
have a fleshy pericarp with 10–15 mm thick on the tree. They are
sub-globose and whitish-to pinkish-yellow color. Every fruiting
season, a mature rose apple tree produces about 35.57 g of fruit,
with 7.16 cm length and 5.15 cm width. The epicarp of the fruit is
thin, smooth, and reddish, while the mesocarp and endocarp are
whitish and succulent,Figure 1 (Daly et al., 2016; Mangini et al.,
2020).
PHYTOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Phenolic compounds are mainly present in the leaves of S.
jambos. They are represented by flavonoids, ellagitannins,
phloroglucinols, and phenolic acids, Table 1; Figure 2
(Rocchetti et al., 2019; Slowing et al., 1994; Slowing et al.,
1996; Sobeh et al., 2018). Flavonoids are the most abundant
group of compounds while quercetin sounds to be the most
abundant monomer in every organ of the plant, except the stem
bark. It is found in both aglycone and saponin forms. Only
flavone and chalcone-types of flavonoids occur in S. jambos
(Reynertson et al., 2008). Some anthocyanidins have also been
detected in the plant mainly, petunidin 3-O-glucoside,
pelargonidin 3-O-(6′′-malonyl-glucoside) and delphinidin 3-O-
galactoside (Rocchetti et al., 2019). Catechin has been identified
from the leaves of the plant suggesting a tentative occurrence of
non-hydrolysable tannins in the plant. As part of tannins, only
ellagitannins (hydrolysable tannins) have been found in some
plant extracts to date. Likewise, ellagic acid monomer derivatives
have also been reported in the leaves and stem bark of the plant.
Moreover, phenolic acids, listed as intermediates in the
metabolism of flavonoids and ellagic acids like gallic acid and
cinnamic acid, have also been alarmed in the leaves and fruit of S.
jambos. Gallic acid is the most abundant and distributed phenolic
acid in the plant. The other phenolic acids were either
glycosylated benzoic acid or derivatives of phenylpropanoids.
Phloroglucinols also occur in S. jambos leaves. Though only one
report highlighted their presence in S. jambos, phloroglucinols are
well distributed in Myrtaceae family. The seven compounds of
this class were isolated from a Chinese species and no trace of one
of this group of compounds was mentioned in the Egyptian or
Brazilian varieties, Table 1; Figure 2 (Li et al., 2015).
Pentacyclic triterpenoids are also abundant in the plant
especially in the leaves and stem bark. They belong to
oleanane, ursane, lupane and friedelane subclasses. The major
ones were betulinic acid and friedelin. Saponins of triterpenes
have not yet been isolated except the readily available β-sitosterol
glucoside, Table 1 (Kuiate et al., 2007; Li et al., 2015). Roots and
flowers of the plant have not been investigated yet.
The essential oil of the plant leaves contain mostly
volatile sesquiterpenes including δ-cadinene, cumaldehyde, β-

himachalene, isocaryophyllene, and β-cedrene, Table 1 (Khalaf
et al., 2021). Linalool is one of the essential oil markers in the
identification of the plant fruit. Indeed, linalool, cinnamyl
alcohol, and geraniol are the main volatile terpenes in the
extracts. Differences were observed in the volatile aromatic
composition of fruits from the Brazilian, Malaysian, and
Egyptian species. Linalool was found as the main compound
in the Brazilian fruits while 3-phenylpropyl alcohol (Z)-3-hexen-
1-ol and (Z)- cinnamaldehydes were identified as major
compounds in the Malaysian and Egyptian ecospecies (Vernin
et al., 1991; Wong and Lai, 1996; Guedes et al., 2004; Ghareeb
et al., 2017).
TRADITIONAL USES
Rose apple carries a long history as essential traditional medicine
with a broad spectrum of application in various cultures. In India,
the fruit tonic helps to improve brain and liver health while fruit
infusions convey diuretic property (Morton, 1987). Moreover, the
juices from macerated leaves in water were used as a febrifuge
(Maskey and Shah, 1982). Dysentery is also alleviated by the seeds
together with diarrhea, and catarrh. Furthermore, the flowers are
assumed to relieve fever (Baliga et al., 2017). The infusion of the
powdered leaves is beneficial to diabetes (Maskey and Shah,
1982). In South American cultures, the seeds have an
anesthetic property whereas leaf decoction is applied to sore
eyes, and used as diuretic, expectorant and to treat rheumatism
(Maskey and Shah, 1982). The decoction of the bark is
administered to treat asthma, bronchitis, and hoarseness
(Maskey and Shah, 1982). The plant is also used to treat
hemorrhages, syphilis, leprosy, wounds, ulcers, and lung
diseases due to its potency to relieve fever and pains. In
China, each plant organ is used to treat digestive tract and
tooth pains (Mahmoud et al., 2021; Reis et al., 2021).
BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES
The biological applications of S. jambos are rich and diverse.
Isolates were screened in accordance with the traditional uses of
the plant encountered worldwide. Mainly, plant extracts and
compounds have presented antifungal, antibacterial,
hepatoprotective, analgesic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-pyretic activities, Figure 3. The
main pharmacological characteristics of S. jambos are listed in
Tables 2–4.
Toxicity Studies
To date, only few literatures have reported the toxicity of the
plant. The leaf extract of S. jambos is safe at a dose up to 5 g/kg
b.wt. assessed by the acute toxicity test (Dhanabalan and
Devakumar, 2014). The toxicity of the methanol extract of S.
jambos and its fraction were evaluated by shrimp lethality
bioassay. Methanolic extract and carbon tetrachloride fraction
displayed significant lethality with LC50  6.97 and 13.61 μg/ml,
