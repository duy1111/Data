Major Bioactive Alkaloids and Biological Activities of Tabernaemontana Species (Apocynaceae) 

Major Bioactive Components and Biological Activities of Tabernaemontana Species
The Tabernaemontana genus acquires a generous source of monoterpene indole alkaloids, which are derived from the aromatic acid tryptophan and the iridoid terpene secologanin [6]. Monoterpene indole alkaloids have been found to exhibit numerous skeletal types, namely seco-tabersonine alkaloids, bis-vobtusine-type alkaloids, and bis-vosbsinyl-ibogan indole alkaloids [3,11]. Currently, there are > 1800 structurally diverse monoterpene-derived indole alkaloids that have been classified within Tabernaemontana [3,6]. Another major class of alkaloids identified in this genus is heterodimeric bis-indole alkaloids [6]. This compound has been characterized by the biosynthesis of dimeric structures from two independent-class alkaloids [6]
For centuries, several Tabernaemontana species, such as T. divaricata, T. catharinensis, T. crassa, and T. elegans, have been exploited in traditional and folk medicine for the treatment of illnesses and the prevention of diseases and ailments, such as sore throat, hypertension, abdominal pain, and pulmonary disease [9,20,70,71,72]. A variety of chemical compounds extracted from many parts of Tabernaemontana species reportedly contain alkaloids, which exhibit biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticholinesterase, antineurodegenerative, anticancer, antidiabetic, antivenom, larvicidal, antihypertensive, wound healing, analgesic, and many other activities [2,3,6,9,71,72]. The details of the isolated compounds and respective pharmacological properties of a few Tabernaemontana species are summarized in the following paragraphs.
The findings of Nicola et al. [9] provide scientific support to the frequently used traditional medicinal plant T. catharinensis. The outcomes of the study revealed the presence of major alkaloids, such as 16-epi-affinine, coronaridine-hydroxyindolenine, voachalotine, voacristine-hydroxyindolenine, 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, and a derivative of voacristine or voacangine (Table 1). It was suggested by Nicola et al. [9] that these chemical constituents exhibited anticholinesterase activity and can be recommended for the future treatment of neurodegenerative disease. According to Mairura [45], a substantial amount of indole alkaloids have been identified and isolated from the stem bark, rootbark, and seeds of T. crassa. Major alkaloids include those of the ibogan class, such as coronaridine, mono- and di-methoxy derivatives of isovoacangine, conopharyngine, and the aspidospermatan-class apparicine (Table 1). Mairura [45] explained that the plant is highly toxic, as crude ethanolic extracts were found to be lethal to test subjects. Conversely, the study of Kuete et al. [73] investigated the toxicity of hydro-ethanol stem-bark extracts and the results showed no toxicological activity, thus suggesting a novel source of naturally produced drugs. Ingkaninan et al. [53] investigated the phytochemical properties of the flowers, leaves, stems, and root extracts of T. divaricata. Additionally, four isolated compounds, namely 19,20-dihydrotabernamine, 19,20-dihydro-ervahanine A, conodurine, and tabernaelegantine A, were screened for biological activity. The findings revealed that the extracts and respective compounds displayed high antiacetylcholinesterase activity. Furthermore, studies have shown that isolated compounds from T. divaricata, such as conophylline, were effective against in several cell lines [74]. Previous phytochemical research has shown T. elegans to contain several monoterpenoid indole alkaloids of which 24 were previously isolated [56]. The major indole alkaloidal components extracted from the whole plant and root bark of T. elegans were vobasine, dregamine, and tabernaemontaninol [6,16,55]. A recent study by Pallant et al. [20] reported the isolation and identification of alkaloids in the root extract of T. elegans. Major components observed were dregamine and voacangine, which exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and Mycobacterium species.
Despite the variety of biologically active compounds displayed in the above-mentioned species and Table 1, several other Tabernaemontana species, such as T. ventricosa, lack an in-depth chemical and pharmacological investigation. A few studies have observed the bioactivity of T. ventricosa [1,75]. Van Beek et al. [1] reported that the alkaloid akuammicine, belonging to the strychnan class, exhibited opioid activity in opiate receptor studies. The same group investigated the antibacterial, antifungal, and antimalarial activities of T. ventricosa extracts; however, no activity was observed in vitro. Mehrbod et al. [75] investigated the effect of T. ventricosa plant extracts on the influenza A virus. This investigation supported the study of Van Beek et al. [1], as the results concluded that the leaf extracts of T. ventricosa were ineffective against the influenza A virus. Due to the traditional uses of T. ventricosa being very similar to those of other well-known studied species, little to no studies have been conducted on T. ventricosa, thus it is necessary to evaluate the complete medicinal potential of this species and other Tabernaemontana species to determine its probable pharmacological activities. Considering the several uses of Tabernaemontana species in traditional medicine, many of their proposed biological activities have been confirmed, others invalidated, while countless species remain undefined [2]. Additionally, the improvements in science and medicine have allowed the discovery of new properties of extracts, fractionations, and the identification and isolation of novel compounds [2].
2.1. Antioxidant Activity
Antioxidants are identified as molecules or compounds that regulate the process of autoxidation either by intersecting the movement of free radicals or directly constraining their formation [76,77]. Medicinal plants are often recognized for their rich source of antioxidants, which include phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, volatile oils, carotenoids, and anthocyanidins [77]. These compounds target free radicals by quenching oxygen molecules, breaking antioxidant chains, donating hydrogen molecules, or acting as reducing agents [76,78]. Therefore, antioxidants are suggested to decrease oxidative stress, improve immune function, and increase healthy longevity [76,77,78]. Several factors can alter the antioxidant capacity of a certain species; these include the rate of reaction between the samples and the reactive species and the concentration ratio between the antioxidant and the target [2]. There are multiple methods used to determine the antioxidant activity of plant species; however, various methods may result in variation of the results [79]. Many species within the Tabernaemontana genus have been investigated for their antioxidant activity using different techniques, which include the inhibition and scavenging activity of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, reducing capacity, and metal-chelating capacity [2]. The most frequently studied species within the genus is T. catharinensis [9]. Table 2 summarizes the antioxidant properties of Tabernaemontana species. Boligon et al. [80] investigated the crude leaf extracts and fractions of T. catharinensis by using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances technique. Ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions, yielding a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6.71 ± 0.19 μg/mL and 26.15 ± 0.08 μg/mL, respectively, displayed optimal results. Furthermore, the same study also assessed the 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition of T. catharinensis extracts, which exhibited good results, with an IC50 value of 4.64 ± 1.25 to 27.78 ± 0.93 mg/mL [80]. Additionally, Nicola et al. [9] examined the antioxidant activity of the alkaloidal fraction in the branch and leaf ethanolic extracts of T. catharinensis. The findings of the study revealed significant antioxidant activity from the alkaloidal fraction, with an IC50 of 37.18 μg/mL [9].
 2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity
Inflammation is defined as a compound biological process that involves an adamant response of an organism to injury or damage of tissue [109]. The development of inflammation is often induced by microbial infection, chemical injury, cell injury, and death [110]. The consequences of these inducers are primarily indicated by pain, redness, heat, and swelling, which arise due to the deviations in blood flow, capillary permeability, and afferent nerve fibers [111,112]. Subsequently, these changes imitate the restoration of inflamed tissue and constrain additional damage to the organism [109]. Based on the characteristics of inflammation, this composite process is divided into two major types known as acute and chronic inflammation [72,109,113]. Acute inflammation occurs almost instantly, or a few hours following injury, and usually displays symptoms of redness, heat, and edema [72]. Whereas, chronic inflammation occurs over an extended interval and is histologically characterized by the occurrence of lymphocytes and macrophages, which subsequently results in the development of fibrosis and necrosis tissue [114]. The standardized protocol for the evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity comprises ex vivo and in vivo experiments [2]. Many Tabernaemontana species have been assessed for anti-inflammatory activity. Table 3 summarizes those anti-inflammatory properties of Tabernaemontana species. Jolly et al. [93], investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of ethanolic flower extract obtained from T. divaricata. Mice models were subjected to acute carrageenan and chronic formalin [93]. The results showed significant anti-inflammatory activity in both models at a dose of 100 mg kg−1, in comparison to the standard reference drug diclofenac (25 mg kg−1) [38]. Furthermore, Jain et al. [115] examined the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of T. divaricata leaves. In this study, hexane fractionations containing a profuse source of flavonoids were tested on male albino mice [115]. The results revealed extensive anti-inflammatory activity, which displayed enhanced results in comparison to the positive drug indomethacin [115].
 2.3. Antimicrobial Activity
Antimicrobials are defined as complex compounds that constrain the development of microorganisms at diminutive concentrations [128]. These compounds are often described as secondary metabolites and are regularly produced and extracted from medicinal plants or microorganisms [129]. The efficiency of antimicrobial activity is dependent upon several factors, such as various microbial strains, technique (in vivo or in vitro assay), and type of sample [2]. Studies have reported the evaluation of Tabernaemontana extracts as natural antibiotics [3]. Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, such as voacamine type and 3-hydroxy-iboga, are biologically active compounds and are reportedly used as antimicrobial agents, inhibiting the growth of bacteria, fungi, and parasites [3]. Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7 summarize the antifungal, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiamoebic properties of Tabernaemontana species.
 2.3.1. Antifungal Activity
Singh et al. [54] investigated the antifungal activity of a biologically active compound from T. divaricata. A major compound from the Tabernaemontana genus, coronaridine (Table 1), was identified and isolated from the ethanolic extract of T. divaricata [54]. In the study, coronaridine displayed weak antifungal activity against Penicillium chrysogenum, comparable with nystatin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 9.8–14.0 mg/mL] [54]. Conversely, Boligon et al. [132] investigated the dichloromethane and n-butanol fractions of ethanolic leaf extracts from T. catharinensis. The dichloromethane fraction showed significant activity against the fungal strains C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. neoformans, S. cerevisiae, A. flavus, and A. fumigatus, with MIC ranging from 31.25 to 1000 mg/mL [132].
2.3.2. Antiviral Activity
Boligon et al. [132] evaluated the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions from the ethanolic extracts of T. catharinensis. The extracts and fractions displayed substantial antiviral activity on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in contrast to acyclovir (IC50 1.5 mg/mL) [132]. Furthermore, significant antiviral activity was observed from the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions. The dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions of the bark-stem fractions showed IC50 values of 2.62 and 2.88 µg/mL, respectively, whereas the fractions of the leaves showed IC50 values of 0.6 and 2.21 µg/mL, respectively [132]. It is suggested that biologically active compounds, such as steroids, terpenoids, and phenolics, found in the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions are accountable for the antiviral activity [2,132].
2.3.3. Antibacterial Activity
Over the past 50 years, extensive research has been conducted about the advancements in antibacterial medicines [175]. Moreover, due to the reoccurrence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there is an excessive necessity for the development of novel and innovative antibacterial agents against those displaying multidrug resistance [175,176]. Approximately 25% of modern medication has been established on the core basis of plant-related compounds [177]. Thus, the active screening of medicinal plants is imperative for the discovery of new antibacterial compounds [178]. The indole alkaloids of Tabernaemontana exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities, including antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [133]. Gindri et al. [150] investigated the antibacterial activity of ethanolic extract and its fractions from the leaves of T. catharinensis. The extracts and fractions were tested against multiple bacterial strains, such as S. aureus, Aeromonas sp., Micrococcus sp., P. mirabilis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, which were comparable against the antibiotics ampicillin (MIC = 8.0 mg/mL), cefoperazone (MIC = 16.0 mg/mL), and imipenem (MIC = 0.06 mg/mL). The findings showed positive results against Micrococcus sp., P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa (MIC values of 31.3, 62.5, and 62.5 mg/mL, respectively) [150].
2.3.4. Antiamoebic Activity
Parasitic infections are regarded as one of the leading contributors to human health problems and are often distributed via contaminated food and water sources [179]. Amoebiasis is a lethal disease that arises from the ingestion of pathogenic microorganisms and occurs predominantly in tropical areas, including China, Mexico, the Eastern portion of South America, South-East and West Africa, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent [180,181]. The protozoan parasite E. histolytica is dominant in these regions and affects approximately 12% of the world’s population, whilst being responsible for copious mortality rates, ranging from 40,000 to 110,000 per year [180,182]. Since there is no vaccine against E. histolytica, metronidazole (MNZ) is regularly used to treat infection against amoebiasis; however, there are serious consequences of the drug, such as amoebic resistance and several side effects, including impaired physical and mental development [183]. Due to the severe side effects of MNZ, many infected people have opted for a more natural approach using traditional medicine [180]. Several Tabernaemontana species are often used in various parts of the world for their antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and antiamoebic action. Van Beek et al. [1] investigated a variety of Tabernaemontana species to establish their antiamoebic activity. In the study, approximately 15 Tabernaemontana species were tested against the protozoan E. histolytica. The study exhibited adequate results, as four extracts from three species showed promising activity below 0.5 mg/mL against the parasite protozoan E. histolytica [1]. Additionally, Uwumarongie et al. [141] evaluated the antiamoebic activity of T. pachysiphon root and stem bark extracts. The findings of their study showed relatively high antiamoebic activity against E. histolytica [141].
2.4. Anticancer and Cytotoxicity
The irrepressible division of cells habitually leads to the formation of cell masses, which are frequently termed as ‘growths’ or ‘tumors’ [184]. These masses are classified as malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous) and are often influenced by several characteristics, such as an irregular diet, genetic factors, and ecological aspects [185,186]. These negative influences give rise to an amplified rate of cancer, since approximately 18.1 million people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer [187,188,189]. However, with the consistent applications of effective cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, these values may subside [190,191]. However, among these treatments, chemotherapy remains challenging due to the occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR), which is defined as the resistance of tumors to chemotherapeutic agents [192]. Considering the above, the constant discovery of anticancer agents using medicinal plants has displayed minimal side effects and act as modulators of MDR. Thus, recently, several medicinal plants, especially within the genus Tabernaemontana, have been screened to evaluate their potential effect on the growth and development of cancerous cells [2].
The study conducted by Pereira et al. [33] investigated the isolation, structure, and chemical constituents present in the root bark of T. catharinensis. Twenty-seven compounds were detected in the ethanol and n-butanol extracts, however, only 12 compounds were identified. Approximately three compounds, namely, ibogamine, 3-oxo-coronaridine, and 12-methoxy-4-methylvoachalotine (MMV) (Table 1), showed substantial cytotoxicity against SKBR-3 breast adenocarcinoma and C-8161 human melanoma tumor cell lines [33]. Thind et al. [193] examined the cytotoxic properties of T. divaricata. In the study, various leaf extracts prepared in a range of solvents (chloroform, methanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane) were tested against the following cell lines: HCT-15 (colon), HT-29 (colon), 502,713 (colon), MCF-7 (breast), and PC-3 (prostate) [193]. Ethyl acetate extract was the most promising as it displayed significant cytotoxic activity against the colon cell line (502713) with a low dose of 10 µg/mL [193]. Additionally, the chloroform extracts also showed considerable cytotoxicity against three colon cell lines with a slightly higher dosage of 30 µg/mL [193].
In another study, Rumzhum et al. [96] screened the leaf extracts of T. divaricata using a brine shrimp bioassay. The results of the study revealed possible cytotoxicity (LC50 = 1 µg/mL) in comparison to the positive control, vincristine sulphate (LC50 = 0.3 µg/mL) [95]. Figueiredo et al. [67] reported the cytotoxicity of T. salzmannii root and leaf extracts on human leukemia cells (THP-1). In this study, nine alkaloids were isolated; however, only two alkaloids, isovoacangine and voacangine (Table 1), displayed extensive cancer cell death, with an IC50 of 52.11 and 61.40 µM, respectively [67]. The above-isolated compounds from various Tabernaemontana species are frequently used to treat a range of cancer types, such as breast, germ and renal, leukemia, lung, testicular, ovarian, and colon cancer [17,194,195,196,197,198].
Recently, Rosales et al. [189] also evaluated the anticancer properties of indole alkaloids of T. catharinensis. In the study, six compounds were identified, namely, 16-epiaffinine, 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, affinisine, voachalotine, coronaridinehydroxyindoline, and ibogamine (Table 1) [189]. The isolated indole alkaloids were tested in vitro against several cell lines, including tumor cells A375 (melanoma cell line) and A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells), and non-tumor Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) [189]. In vitro toxicity showed the fractionation containing affinisine demonstrated toxicity against A375, with an IC50 of 11.73 μg/mL, and may be a chemotherapeutic agent for A375 melanoma cells [189]. Table 8 summarizes the anticancer properties of Tabernaemontana species.
 2.5. Acetylcholinesterase Activity
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined as an advanced chronic and aggressive neurodegenerative disease, which is habitually accompanied by the severe disturbance of multiple cortical functions, including memory impairment, judgment, orientation, understanding, language learning capacity, and personality changes [235,236,237]. Clinically, this cognitive disorder is often characterized by the occurrence of several amyloidal beta-peptide plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, atrophy of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, oxidative stress, and reduced neurotransmitter levels [9,238,239]. According to Adewusi and Steenkamp [240], AD is amongst the leading disorders worldwide as it is liable for approximately 50–60% of dementia in elders. Moreover, a dramatic incline, possibly affecting 7–10% of individuals over 65 and 40% of persons over 80 years, is anticipated within the next 50 years, without the intervention of rehabilitation [235,240,241]. Popular methods for the treatment of AD are often based on the cholinergic hypothesis, which suggests that the impairment of memory is directly related to a reduction in the function of cholinergic in the brain [241]. Thus, several approaches regarding the enhancement of acetylcholine levels using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are frequently investigated [239,241,242]. Currently, approved AChE inhibitors include tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galanthamine [238,241,242]. However, despite the beneficial effects on cognitive functioning, these inhibitors have displayed undesirable side effects, such as gastrointestinal issues, nausea, vomiting, and reduced bioavailability [243,244]. Considering the latter, the discovery of alternative natural AChE inhibitors displaying minimal side effects is essential [238,239,244]. Therapeutic plants have been investigated for their complex compounds that contain natural and innovative AChE inhibitors [241,242]. Several Tabernaemontana species have been recognized and investigated for their monoterpene indole alkaloids, which have demonstrated AChE inhibitory activity [245]. Ingkaninan et al. [241] investigated the AChE inhibitory activity of methanolic extracts of T. divaricata. In the study, extracts (0.1 mg/mL) were tested in vivo using rats as test models [241]. The results were promising as approximately 90% of AChE activity was observed. Furthermore, most recently, Athipornchai et al. [245] investigated the AChE inhibitory activity of the methanol, n-hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts of T. pandacaqui flowers. The results revealed that the ethyl acetate extract displayed the strongest AChE inhibitory activity, with inhibition of 35.4% at 5 mg/mL [245]. Considering the latter, prior and recent studies have shown the potential of plant AChE inhibitors, which should be further investigated. Table 9 summarizes the acetylcholinesterase activities of Tabernaemontana species.
