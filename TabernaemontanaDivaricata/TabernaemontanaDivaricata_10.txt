Gastroprotective Effect of Tabernaemontana divaricata (Linn.) R.Br. Flower Methanolic Extract in Wistar Rats

2.1 PLANT MATERIAL
The flowers of Crepe Jasmine (Tabernaemontana divaricata) were collected in the month of
November 2009 from the local areas of Ameerpet and Mallepally (Hyderabad District) and
authenticated by plant taxonomist Dr. Ramana (Department of Botany, Osmania University).
A voucher specimen (0360-OUH) has been deposited in the herbarium for future reference.
2.2 PREPARATION OF EXTRACT
After collection, flowers were shade dried and coarsely powdered. Approximately 500 gm of
powdered flowers were extracted using 99% pure methanol (Carbinol –SD Fine Chemicals)
in a soxhlet apparatus. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure and stored in
an air tight container in a refrigerator at temperature below 10° C. Dried mass of crude
Tabernaemontana divaricata flower methanolic extract (TDFME) was weighed and recorded.
The solution of TDFME was prepared using distilled water for the evaluation of anti-ulcer
activity.
2.3 EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS
Swiss albino mice weighing 20-30gm were used to assess acute toxicity whereas adult male
wistar rats weighing 150-200 gm were used to evaluate anti-ulcer activity by pyloric ligation
induced gastric ulceration model. The animals were maintained under standard laboratory
conditions in polypropylene cages under 12 hr light/dark cycle, controlled temperature (24 ±
2°C), fed with commercial pellet diet and water ad-libitum in an animal house approved by
Committee for the Purpose and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (Reg no.
1185/a/08/CPCSEA). All the animals were acclimatized to the laboratory environment for 10
days before commencement of the experiments. The experimental protocol was approved
by Institutional Animal Ethical Committee, MESCO College of Pharmacy, Mustaidpura,
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.
2.4 ACUTE TOXICITY STUDY
Acute toxicity test was performed in mice according to staircase method. Mice divided into
four groups with five animals per dose. The dose was increased from 250-1000 mg/kg, b.w
p.o. Mice were observed individually after dosing with special supervision given during first 4
hours and periodically thereafter for first 24 hours (Pathak et al., 2010).
2.5 EVALUATION OF ANTI-ULCER ACTIVITY
2.5.1 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Rats were divided into three groups, each consisting 6 and treated with the respective test
solutions as given below -
Group I (Control): Distilled water (1 ml/ 100gm, p.o)
Group II (Standard): Omeprazole (8 mg/kg, b.w p.o)
Group III (Test): TDFME (500 mg/kg, b.w p.o)
2.5.2 PYLORIC LIGATION INDUCED GASTRIC ULCERATION MODEL
(KULKARNI, 1999)
Rats were fasted in individual cages for 24 hours. Care was taken to avoid coprophagy.
Distilled water, Omeprazole 8 mg/kg and TDFME 500 mg/kg were administered orally 30
mins prior to pyloric ligation. Under light ether anaesthesia, the abdomen was cut open by
making a small incision below the xiphoid process. Pyloric portion of the stomach was
slightly lifted out and ligated avoiding traction to the pylorus or damage to its blood supply.
The stomach was replaced carefully and the abdominal wall was closed by interrupted
sutures. Rats were sacrificed by an over dose of anesthetic ether after
ligation.
2.5.2.1 Collection & Measurement of Gastric juice
The stomachs were excised carefully by keeping the oesophagus closed and opened along
the greater curvature, luminal contents were removed. The gastric contents were collected
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The centrifuged samples were decanted and volume
of gastric juice was noted.
2.5.2.2 Determination of pH of Gastric juice
1 ml of the supernatant liquid was diluted to 10 ml using distilled water. The pH of the
solution was recorded by digital pH meter.

2.5.2.3 Estimation of Free and Total Acidities
The above solution was titrated against 0.01 N NaOH using Topfer’s reagent as indicator.
When the solution turned orange in colour, volume of NaOH was noted that corresponds to
free acidity. Further, the titration was continued till the solution regained pink colour. The
total volume of NaOH was noted, that corresponds to the total acidity.
2.5.2.4 Assessment of Ulcer Index
Mean ulcer score for each animal is expressed as Ulcer Index. The stomachs were washed
in running water to detect ulcers in the glandular portion of the stomach. The number of
ulcers per stomach was noted and severity scoring was done microscopically with the help
of hand lens (10X) and scoring was done as per Kulkarni (1999).
0 = Normal Stomach; 0.5 = Red Colouration
1 = Spot Ulcers; 1.5 = Haemorraghic Streaks
2 = Ulcers > 3 mm but < 5 mm; 3 = Ulcers > 5 mm
2.5.2.5 Calculation of Percentage Protection
The percentage protection was calculated by the following formula:
Percentage Protection = 100 – (Ut / Uc X 100)
Where, Ut = Ulcer Index of treated group and Uc = Ulcer Index of control group
2.6 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The values are expressed as Mean ± Standard Error of Mean. P< 0.01 was considered
significant and is denoted as **. Data of gastric juice, pH & Ulcer score was analyzed by
One-way Analysis of Variance whereas free & total acidities were analyzed by Kruskal –
Wallis test (non-parametric ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-hoc test

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 RESULTS OF ORAL ACUTE TOXICITY
The percentage yield of TDFME (dried crude extract) obtained was 14%. The acute toxicity
study reveals that maximum tolerable dose of TDFME is more than 1000 mg/kg as all the
test doses were found to be safe and no mortality or signs of toxicity were observed. In an
earlier study TDFME exhibited anti-convulsant activity at 500 mg/kg, hence the same test
dose was selected (Khan and Mukhram, 2011). The results are illustrated in Figures 1-5.
3.2 RESULTS OF ANTI-ULCER ACTIVITY SCREENING
Standard drug and TDFME significantly (p<0.01) decreased volume of gastric juice from 3.6
± 0.4761 (Control) to 1.43 ± 0.1801 and 1.55 ± 0.1979 respectively. A significant decrease of
equal degree in free and total acidities was observed in both the groups. Similarly the ulcer
index significantly (p<0.01) reduced from 6.5 ± 0.6708 (Control) to 1.33 ± 0.4216 and 0.66 ±
0.2789 for the standard and test groups respectively. Likewise both the treatments raised pH
significantly (p<0.01) from 2.63 ± 0.3658 (Control) to 6.36 ± 0.4485 (Standard) and 4.75 ±
0.5246 (TDFME). Percentage protection produced by standard and test were 89.84% and
79.53% respectively. The test extract influenced all the parameters positively and magnitude
of effect was comparable to that of standard. Thus, from the above results it is evident that
TDFME possesses gastroprotective effect
