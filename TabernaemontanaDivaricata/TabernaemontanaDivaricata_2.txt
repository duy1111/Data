Use and Management

Crepe jasmine is a good choice for use in a shrubbery border or as a specimen planting. Its rounded form makes it a good foundation plant. The glossy foliage makes it nicely suited for any prominent position in the landscape.

Crepe jasmine grows well in full sun or partial shade (plants look better in partial shade) on any moist but well-drained soil, requiring less water once established. Plant on 4- to 5-foot centers to form a mass planting. The plant is best suited for acid soil, but regular fertilizing can help prevent chlorosis on slightly alkaline soil. It requires frequent fertilization in highly alkaline soils.

Propagation is by cuttings.
