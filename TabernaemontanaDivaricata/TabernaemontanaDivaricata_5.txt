Tabernaemontana divaricata Plant Pono

Family: Apocynaceae

A shrub with everblooming flowers. It has a round shape and a repeated Y forked branching habit. The pure white flowers pop out amongst the shiny green leaves. The intoxicating scent is most potent at night.

Native to northern India, China, North Thailand, crepe jasmine thrives in tropical climates. Dye, incense, perfume, and medicines are made from this shrub.

An evergreen, crepe jasmine drops little to no rubbish. It is a low maintenance plant once established. It thrives with light shade; however, full sun won’t harm it. Fertilize every three to four months. It prefers slightly acidic soil. Mulch the base to retain moisture. Germination is by seed, cutting, or air layer.

Sometimes confused with gardenia and jasmine, they are in different families altogether. Crepe jasmine is in the Aponeace family, the same family as plumeria. Latex, dichotomous branching, and twisted buds are identifying characteristics of this plant.
