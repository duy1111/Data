Results suggest the guava leaf extract has radiomodulating activity in vivo due to its powerful antioxidant activity in vitro and has potential as antioxidant supplement to minimize the damaging effects of radiation, preventing DNA damage and apoptosis. (82)
- Antimicrobial Effect / Enteric Pathogens: Study evaluated various solvent extracts of leaves for antimicrobial activity against nine enteric pathogens viz., E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A and B, S. sonnei, S. dysenteriae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., and Klebsiella spp. An EE showed highest antimicrobial activity against Salmonella paratyphi A, a ME against Citrobacter spp, an diethyl ether extract against Klebsiella spp., and an acetone extract against Shigella dysenteriae. (83)
- Hyperglycemic / Peel: Study has shown the fruit extract to have hypoglycemic effect in alloxan treated mice and human subjects. This study evaluated the glycemic potential of P. guajava fruit peel extract on blood glucose level of normal and STZ-induced diabetic rats using FBS and GTT tests. Results showed fruit peel extract to have a hyperglycemic effect. The hyperglycemic effect of the fruit peel advises that diabetic patients should peel off the guava fruits before consuming. Study suggests possible use in controlling hypoglycemia due to excess of insulin or other hypoglycemic drugs. (84)
- Antihyperglycemic / Leaves: Study evaluated the effect of aqueous and ethanol soluble solid extracts of guava leaves on hypoglycemia and glucose metabolism in T2 diabetic rats. Acute and long-term feeding tests showed a significant reduction in blood sugar in diabetic rats fed with the extracts of guava leaves (p<0.05). Long-term administration increased plasma insulin level and glucose utilization in diabetic rats. there was also higher activities of hepatic hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and G6PD in diabetic rats fed with aqueous extracts. (85)
- Anti-Solar Activity / Leaves: Study evaluated the anti-solar activity of P. guajava aqueous extract from pulverized dried leaves. Photo-protective activity was evaluated using UV visible spectrophotometry. The UV scanning absorption spectra of the extract showed very strong absorption at 0.279A with max at 268 nm. Results suggest an ability to absorb the entire UV range. Activity was attributed to flavonoids. The anti-solar activity suggests potential utility in anti-solar formulations and a cheaper and safe alternative to chemical sunscreens. (86)
- Antimicrobial / Periodontal Disease / Leaves:Study evaluated the inhibitory effect of ethanolic (EGE) and aqueous (AGE) guava leaf extracts on Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and assessed its antiproteolytic activity on P. gingivalis. Results sowed significant activity against the periodontal pathogens and suggests potential therapeutic agent against periodontitis. (87)
- Antifungal / Fruits and Leaves: Study evaluated the antifungal activities of ethanolic, methanolic, ethyl acetate and hot water extracts from leaves and fruits of P. guajava against four fungal species i.e., M. canis, T. rubrum, A. niger, and C. albicans. The methanolic fruit extract showed best activity with zone of inhibition of 29 mm against Trichophyton rubrum. Antifungal activity was attributed to tannins, phlobatannins, saponins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and polyphenols. (88)
- Antidiarrheal Mechanisms of Action / Leaves: Study evaluated a hot aqueous extract of dried leaves on parameters associated with pathogenicity of infectious diarrhea, seeking to understand possible mechanisms of action in controlling infectious diarrhea, and comparing it with quercetin. Results suggest components other than quercetin contribute to the antidiarrheal action. Various mechanisms are proposed viz., antimicrobial activity, antispasmodic activity, inhibition of watery secretion and inhibition of acetylcholine release. (89)
- Preferential Inhibition of Bacterial Elastase / Leaves:Study evaluated the inhibitory effect of P. guajava leaf extracts on bacterial elastase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and human neutrophil elastase (HNE). The methanolic and aqueous extract of leaves inhibited both bacterial elastase and HNE. The inhibition was more potent toward bacterial elastase. The inhibitory effect was attributed to phenolic compounds. (90)
- Anticestodal / Leaves: Study evaluated the anticestodal efficacy of P. guajava leaf extract using experimental Hymenolepis diminuta infection in rats. Results showed reduction in EPG of faeces count in a dose-dependent manner, low recovery of worms remaining in the intestine, and dose-dependent host clearance. In all experimental models, the anticestodal efficacy was significantly comparable with that of praziquantel (PZQ), the standard anticestodal drug. Results support its folkloric medicinal use in the treatment of intestinal-worm infections in northeast India. (91)
- Increase Platelet Count / Combination of Red Yeast Rice, Red Guava Leaf Extract and Red Guava Fruit: Dengue fever leads to decrease in thrombocytes. Decreased platelet count was induced by quinine to produce a dengue-like thrombocytopenic state. Study evaluated the effect of combination of angkak (red yeast rice), guava fruit juice and guava leaf extract on blood hematology profile of quinine-induced male Sprague-Dawley rats. The highest increase in platelet count (up to 127%) was seen with 400 mg/kbw of angkak combined with guava juice 10 g/kbw per day (p<0.05). Combination of angkak and leaves ethanol extract significant increase erythrocyte count and hematocrit value. (92)
- Anti-Hemolytic Activity / Leaves:Study evaluated an ethanolic leaf extract of P. guajava for the anti-hemolytic activity against H2O2 induced hemolysis in chicken erythrocytes. Results showed moderate anti-hemolytic activity in the range from 12.5% to 43.75% at varying extract concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg/ml. (93)
