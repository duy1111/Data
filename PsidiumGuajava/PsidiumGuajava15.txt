Cultivation Details
The guava is a hardy tree that adapts to a wide range of growing conditions from the humid lowland tropics to the cooler elevations, fruiting at elevations up to 1,500 metres and surviving as high as 2,000 metres[200
It can stand a wide range of temperatures; the highest yields are recorded at mean temperatures of 23 - 28째c, whilst in the subtropics quiescent trees can withstand light frost, and 3.5 - 6 months (depending on the cultivar) of mean temperatures above 16째c are sufficient for flowering and fruitin When dormant, the plant can survive temperatures down to about -5째c, but young growth can be severely damaged at -1째c[418 It can also tolerate low to moderate rainfall levels though, for good fruiting, it requires at least 1,000mm per annum with a clear dry period to allow its fruit to ripen[200 It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 1,000 - 3,000mm, but can tolerate 400 - 5,000mm[418 For maximum production in the tropics it requires rainfall distributed over the yea If fruit ripens during a very wet period it loses flavour and may spli
Prefers a fertile, moisture-retentive soil and a sunny position[307 Plants are tolerant of a range of soil conditions[200 Moderately tolerant of saline soils[404 Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4 - 8.5[418 The plant is more drought-resistant than most tropical fruit crop
The guava often escapes from cultivation and is considered a noxious weed in many tropical pasture lands - its proliferation may result in the abandonment of a pastur
There are many named varieties, selected for their superior fruit forms[301
Plants have some deep roots, but do not form a taproo
The trees flower all year round[307 Seedlings may flower within 2 years; clonally propagated trees often begin to bear during the first year after plantin Trees reach full bearing after 5 - 8 years, depending on growing conditions and spacin The guava is not a long-lived tree (about 40 years), but the plants may bear heavily for 15 - 25 year
Average yields are between 30 - 40 kg/plant in 5 year-old plants and will reach a maximum production of 50 - 70 kg at about 7 years if well manage
Edible Uses
