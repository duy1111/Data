Nutritional and Health Benefits of Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.): A Review

Abstract
Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam., which is commonly known as jackfruit is a tropical climacteric fruit, belonging to Moraceae family, is native to Western Ghats of India and common in Asia, Africa, and some regions in South America. It is known to be the largest edible fruit in the world. Jackfruit is rich in nutrients including carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. Both the seeds and the flesh of jackfruit are consumed as curries and boiled forms, while the flesh in fully ripen stage can be eaten directly as a fruit. Several countries have developed different food products such as jam, jellies, marmalades, and ice creams using pureed jackfruit. The several parts of jack tree including fruits, leaves, and barks have been extensively used in traditional medicine due to its anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti inflammatory, wound healing, and hypoglycemic effects. Despite all these benefits, unfortunately, the fruit is underutilized in commercial scale processing in regions where it is grown. The aim of this review is to disseminate the knowledge on nutritional and health benefits of jackfruit, in order to promote utilization of jackfruit for commercial scale food production.
ntroduction
Jackfruit is one of the commonly consumed foods in Sri Lanka from the ancient time. It is a nonseasonal fruit and had a major contribution to the food supply of the people and their livestock when there were short supplies of staple food grains [1, 2]. Therefore, it is referred to as poorman's food [3].
It is a monoecious tree and both male and female inflorescences are found on the same tree [4, 5]. The fertilization is by cross pollination and the propagation is mostly through seeds. The complete fruit development process takes about three to seven months from the pollination, varying in different countries.
Origin and Distribution
Jackfruit is considered to be originated in the rain forests of the Western Ghats in the Southwestern part of India, but some authors argue that Malaysia could be the possible centre of origin [7]. It is found in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America [2, 6, 8, 9]. Jacktree grows in warm and moist regions [4, 10].
Jacktree and the Fruits
Jacktree is a medium sized evergreen tree, and typically reaches 8 25 m in height [11]. The tree grows rapidly in early years, up to 1.5 m/year (5 ft/year) in height, slowing to about 0.5 m/year (20 in/year) as the tree reaches maturity [12]. It has a straight rough stem and a green or black bark which has a thickness of around 1.25cm, exuding milky latex [13].
The leaves are broad, elliptic, dark green in colour and alternate. They are often deeply lobed when juvenile on young shoots. Male heads are usually sessile or on short peduncles receptacles and sometimes born on the ultimate twing, while female heads are oblong ovoid receptacle [11–14].
Jackfruit has a relatively high productivity, about 25.71 t/ha [15]. The fruits are borne in the main and side branches of the tree [16]. A mature jacktree can yield from ten to two hundred fruits [17–21].
They are dicotyledonous compound fruits [22], which are oblong cylindrical in shape, and the length of the fruits ranges from 22 to 90 centimeters with the diameter 13 50 centimeters. The weight of individual fruits may vary between 2 and 20 kilo grams, and larger fruits of about 50 kilograms have been recorded [20, 23, 24].
Jackfruit has a green to yellow brown exterior rind that is composed of hexagonal, bluntly conical carpel apices that cover a thick, rubbery, and whitish to yellowish wall [11]. It is a multiple aggregate fruit which is formed by the fusion of multiple flowers in an inflorescence [16]. About 30% of the fruit weight is occupied by the flesh [8, 9, 20, 23, 24]. There are large number of bulbs inside the fruit, which have high nutritional value.
The fruit is made up of three main regions. They are
the fruit axis;
the persistent perianth;
the true fruit.
Due to the presence of laticiferous cells that produce latex, which helps to hold the fruits together, the axis and the core of the fruit are inedible.
The perianth is made up of three regions:
the bulb (the lower fleshy edible region);
the middle fused region that forms the rind of the syncarp;
horny nonedible region commonly known as the spikes [11, 22].
The fruit colour changes from yellowish green to yellow due to the conversion of chlorophylls, anthocyanins, and carotenoids like pigments during ripening [25]. Depending on the variety, the colour of the bulb can be cream, white, light yellow, yellow, deep yellow, lemon yellow light saffron, saffron, deep saffron, or orange [8].
Jackfruit seeds are light brown, rounded, 2 3 cm in length by 1 1.5 cm in diameter [11]. They are surrounded by the flesh and enclosed in a white aril surrounding a thin brown spermoderm, which covers the fleshy white cotyledon. It has been found that these are rich in carbohydrates and proteins [16, 26].

There is a widespread belief that excessive consumption of jackfruit flakes can lead to certain digestive disorders. The utilization of jackfruit as a commercial crop is limited due to its wide variations in fruit quality and long seed dormancy [21].
The fruits must be utilized as early as possible when it reached the maturity as very sharp off flavours can be developed. Therefore, it is practiced to harvest the fruit when it is firm and in a semiripen condition before ripening on the tree anden store until becoming soft and fit for processing [25].
Varieties of Jackfruit
Several studies including Hossain [27]; Saha et al. [28]; and Jagadeesh et al. [8] have reported diversity in jackfruit, based mainly on morphological, phenotypic, and organoleptic characteristics like the size of the tree, structure of the leaf, fruit form, age of fruit bearing, quality of the fruit flesh, their size, shape, density of spines, colour, texture, odor, quality, and period of maturity [18, 29]. According to Singh [30] and Vinning and Moody [31], there are at least 30 strains of jackfruit in the Indian subcontinent and 30 more types in Malaysia. In Sri Lanka, several jackfruit cultivars such as ‘Vela', ‘Varaka (Waraka)', ‘Peniwaraka', ‘Kuruwaraka', Singapore, or the Ceylon Jack are distributed [6].
However, there are two main varieties of jackfruit: firm and soft. In the firm variety, the perianth remains firm even at full ripeness, while in the soft variety the perianths become soft and fleshy on ripening [2]. The soft variety has fruits with small, fibrous, soft, and spongy flakes with very sweet carpels, whereas the firm variety is crunchy with crisp carpels and not sweet as the soft variety. The firm variety is considered to be of high quality [14]. Some studies have reported variations in the starch, total sugar, and reducing sugar contents of soft and firm types [2, 32].
Chemical Composition and Nutritional Value
The chemical composition of jackfruit varies depending on the variety. When compared with other tropical fruits jackfruit flesh and seeds contain more protein, calcium, iron, and Thiamine [18, 33, 34].
A study has explored that the ripe jackfruit is richer than apple, apricot, avocado, and banana in some minerals and vitamins [25].
The caloric content of jackfruit is low, where 100 g of jackfruit only contains 94 calories [35].
Table 1 depicts the composition of jackfruit according to the findings of several studies [18, 19, 36–39].
Several studies have found that there is a variation in chemical composition of jackfruit in different maturity stages [25].
Carbohydrates
Rahman et al. [40] have reported the presence of a high percentage of starch in jackfruit perianth and seed according to various chemical and histological studies. The starch and dietary fiber content of the flesh increase with the maturity [2].
According to a study carried out by Chrips et al. [41], the carbohydrate concentration of different varieties of jackfruit seed may vary from 37.4% to 42.5%.
Proteins
Jackfruit contains amino acids like arginine, cystine, histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan [42]. The flesh of ripe jackfruit contains 1.9 g proteins per 100g. The protein concentration of the jackfruit seeds may vary from 5.3 to 6.8% [41]. According to Goswami et al. [43], the protein content of the flesh of different varieties of ripen jackfruit has ranged from 0.57 to 0.97%.
Vitamins
Jackfruit is rich in vitamin C [44]. Moreover, it is one of the rare fruits that is rich in B complex group of vitamins and contains very good amounts of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), niacin, riboflavin, and folic acid.
The changes of vitamin contents in different maturity stages of jackfruit have been evaluated by Tiwari and Vidyarthi [25]. The amounts of vitamins according to the study are presented in the Table 2.
