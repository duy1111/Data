Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.

DESCRIPTION AND ETHNOBOTANY
Growth Form	Tree, monoecious, evergreen, height up to 20 m and 80 cm in diameter. Bark is rough or scaly, dark grey to greyish brown in colour. When young, crown is dense and conical but when older, it becomes rounded and spreading.
Foliage	Leaves are thin leathery and obovate elliptic to elliptic. The leaves are smooth on the surface and rough on the undersides. Stipules are ovate acute, deciduous and leave ring like form on the twigs.
Cultivation	Although it can grow on any different types of soil, it performs best in deep, well drained, alluvial and sandy or loamy soils, pH 6.0 7.5. Propagated by seed  only use large seed, wash the seed thoroughly to remove the slimy coat around the seed, and remove the horny part of pericarp to improve germination. If short storage is needed, do not let it dry out and should store at an airtight container at 20°C. Germination takes place within 35 – 40 days, but if condition is suitable, it will begin as early as within 10 days. You can determine the fruit maturity by: tapping the fruit and it will produce a dull and hollow sound, the skin colour will change from pale green to greenish  or brownish yellow, when the fruit emit a characteristic odour, and the spines will flatten and the space in between will widen. Then harvest it by cutting the stalk with a knife. As the fruit is not hardy, it is best to carefully lowered it to ground.
