Artocarpus heterophyllus   Plants For A Future

Summary
Jackfruit or Artocarpus heterophyllus is a tropical evergreen tree that grows up to 20 m in height. It has one or two main trunks with a smooth and dark green bark. Its fruit is large, spiky, and composite. Its leaves are green, glossy, and leathery. Jackfruit is cultivated for its wide range of uses. Ashes of the leaves are used for treating ulcers, diarrhoea, boils, stomach ache and boils. Seeds are aphrodisiac and as a cooling tonic like the pulp. Root decoction can reduce fever and can treat diarrhoea, skin diseases and asthma. The pulp is an anti syphilitic and a vermifuge. The latex has an anti bacterial activity similar to that of papaya latex. The fruit is edible, either consumed raw or cooked in many ways. The pulp of young fruit and the seeds are cooked as vegetable. The rind of the fruit produces a jelly. The seed can be grounded into a powder and used in biscuit making. Jackfruit can be used to control soil erosion due to its extensive root system. Also, it is a fast growing tree. The wood is a very useful timber for it is resistant to termite attack and fungal and bacterial decay. It can also be used for fuel.

Medicinal Uses
Plants For A Future can not take any responsibility for any adverse effects from the use of plants. Always seek advice from a professional before using a plant medicinally.
The ashes of leaves, with or without oil, are used to treat ulcers, diarrhoea, boils, stomach ache and wounds[ 303 ]. The pulp and seeds of the fruit are regarded as a cooling tonic[ 303 ]. The seeds are said to be an aphrodisiac[ 303 ]. The sap is an anti syphilitic and a vermifuge[ 303 ]. The wood is claimed to have sedative properties, and its pith is said to be able to induce abortion[ 303 ]. A root decoction is used to alleviate fever, treat diarrhoea, skin diseases and asthma[ 303 ]. The bacteriolytic activity of the latex is equal to that of papaya latex[ 303 ]. Dried latex yields artotenone, a compound with marked androgenic action; it can also be mixed with vinegar to promote healing of abscesses, snakebite and glandular swellings[ 303 ].
Other uses rating: Medium (3/5). Suitable for growing indoors. Agroforestry Uses: The tree has a wide ranging root system and can be planted to control floods and soil erosion in farms[ 303 ]. It is suitable for use in reforestation projects[ 418 ]. The tree is often used in mixed plantings. It can be used as a shade tree for coffee, planted with coconut groves, has been used as an intercrop in durian orchards, and with mango and citrus[ 303 , 418 ]. Young jackfruit orchards may be intercropped with annual cash crops such as banana, sweet corn and groundnut[ 303 ]. Other Uses The inner part of the bark or bast is occasionally made into cordage or cloth[ 303 ]. The latex obtained from the trunk and branches yields 71.8% resin, consisting of 63.3% fluavilles (yellow) and 8.5% albanes (white). These resins may be valuable in varnishes[ 303 ]. The latex is commonly used as adhesive for mending broken chinaware or earthenware, caulking boats, mending holes of buckets and trapping birds. In India and Brazil, the latex serves as a substitute for rubber[ 303 ]. The bark yields a dark, water soluble resinous gum that contains 3.3% tannin[ 303 ]. When boiled with alum, the sawdust or chips of the heartwood produce a rich yellow dye used for silk and the cotton robes of Buddhist priests[ 303 , 525 ]. Wood is yellow at first, becoming red. It is classified as medium hardwood. It is resistant to termite attack and fungal and bacterial decay and is easy to season[ 303 ]. It takes polish beautifully. Though not as strong as teak, it is considered superior to that wood for furniture, construction, turnery and inlay work, masts, oars, implements and musical instruments. The wood is widely used in India and Sri Lanka and is even exported to Europe[ 303 ]. Roots are highly prized for carvings and picture framing[ 303 ]. The wood is used for fuel[ 418 ].
Cultivation details
A plant of the humid lowland tropics, growing best at an elevation below 1,000 metres, with a mean annual temperature in the range 24   28°c, a mean max temperature of 32   35°c, a mean minimum temperature of 16   20°c, and a mean annual rainfall in the range 900   4,000mm evenly distributed through the year[ 303 ]. Prefers a climate without a dry season, but can tolerate a short dry season[ 525 ]. Jackfruits can grow at higher elevations than the breadfruit and also in cooler and drier climates[ 200 , 303 ]. They can even succeed in warm temperate areas, but they remain small and any fruit is of poor quality[ 200 ]. Trees can bear fruit at latitudes up to 30' from the equator, with good crops up to 25' distant[ 303 ]. Succeeds in a variety of soils[ 296 ]. Prefers a deep, well drained alluvial soil[ 200 ]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5   7.5, tolerating 4.3   8[ 418 ]. Young plants need some shade, but need increasing light levels as they mature[ 200 ]. Mature plants are relatively drought resistant[ 296 ]. Plants have poor drought tolerance[ 418 ]. Slightly more tolerant of cold than breadfruit. There are two main groups of cultivars, one group has soft rinds whilst the other has hard[ 46 ]. Jackfruits produce one of the largest fruits in the world[ 200 ]. The trees have a deep taproot[ 303 ]. Plants can produce their first crop within 3 years of the seed germinating, but 8 years is a more common time[ 296 , 418 ]. Flower and fruit loads are initially low and improve with increasing size and age; trees 2 years old produce about 25 flowers and 3 fruits; trees 5 years old bear as many as 840 flowers, and trees 6 years old 1,500 flowers[ 303 ]. However, only 15 18 fruits develop due to the low production of female spikes (about 0.6 5% of the total number of inflorescences[ 303 ]. Young trees bear more male than female flowers at a ratio of 4:1; production of female flower increases with age. A male to female ratio of 2:1 produces 250 fruits per tree, and as the trees ages, fruit productivity declines[ 303 ]. In suitable environments trees bear fruits and flowers throughout the year, but in areas with distinct dry and wet seasons, flowering occurs in the wet season[ 303 ]. In young trees, fruits are usually borne on branches and in older trees, on trunks and roots[ 303 ]. Jackfruit exhibits fairly rapid growth, attaining a height of 3 metres and a canopy diameter of 2 metres at 2 years of age. In 5 years, the tree height reaches 7 metres and the canopy diameter 4 metres; trees 20 years old are about 18 metres, as tree growth slows down with age[ 303 ].
