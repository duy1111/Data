A Review on the Pharmacological Activities and Phytochemicals of Alpinia officinarum (Galangal) Extracts Derived from Bioassay-Guided Fractionation and Isolation

Alpinia officinarum Hance, also known as lesser galangal, is indigenous to Southeast China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan) and Indochina, and the plant is cultivated in the plains of West Bengal, Assam, and Eastern Himalayas in India.[1] A. officinarum belongs to the Zingiberaceae family. It is a perennial herb with thick, creeping reddish-brown rhizomes, lineolate acuminate ornamental leaves, and showy white flowers in racemes.[2] It has been used conventionally both in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine since the very early times and in Europe since the Middle Ages.[1,3] The rhizome has been used in China for relieving stomach ache, treating colds, invigorating the circulatory system, and reducing swelling.[4] The dry root and rhizome have been used for their antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiulcer, antidiarrhea, anti-emetic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anticoagulation effects.[5,6,7]
Different solvents are available to extract the bioactive compounds from natural products.[8] Various methods such as sonication, heating under reflux, Soxhlet extraction, maceration, and modern extraction techniques including supercritical fluid extraction are commonly used for plant sample extraction.[9,10,11] Alcoholic (methanol or ethanol) solutions frequently provide satisfactory results for the extraction process.[12] It is a common practice when isolating bioactive compounds that a number of different separation techniques such as thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, flash chromatography, Sephadex chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) are used to obtain pure compounds for the determination of structure and biological activity. Besides that, non-chromatographic techniques such as phytochemical screening assay can also be used to obtain and facilitate the identification of the bioactive compounds.[8] These compounds have been reported to possess biological activities due to the presence of various potentially active groups in their molecular structure.[12]
Diarylheptanoid (DAH) is a group of compounds found to have the potential in the development of natural products, with a special characteristic of bearing the 1,7-diphenylheptane skeleton.[13] There have been numerous DAH compounds isolated and reported for their structural characterization and biological activities.[13,14,15,16,17,17,19,20,21] Another group of compounds, polyphenols and flavonoids, are of interest because of their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS).[22] The reduction capability of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals is determined by the decrease in their absorbance at 517 nm induced by antioxidants.[23] Many antioxidants that react quickly with peroxyl radicals may react slowly or may even be inert to DPPH.[24]
Carrageenan paw edema test is used to screen anti-inflammatory drugs as it involves the inhibition of the release and/or action of several mediators â€“ histamine, serotonin, kinin, and prostaglandin.[25,26] The bioactive compounds within A. officinarum may also be responsible for the antiproliferative activity, which have shown to exert anticancer effects on numerous cancer cell lines.[27,28,29,30] It was reported that the galangal extracts could penetrate into the bacterial cell, causing the bacterial membrane to rupture, and resulted in bacterial death.[31] Herein we report the phytochemical and biological activities exerted by the different solvent extracts and fractions and the identified compounds of A. officinarum.
