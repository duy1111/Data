Alpinia: the gold mine of future therapeutics

Amaranthus viridis is an annual herbaceous plant, sometimes perennial for a few years in tropical and subtropical regions7, with a generally erect or ascending habit, which can reach 75 to 80 cm (sometimes 1 m) in height. The green, often reddish, angular section stems are slender, branched, glabrous to pubescent (usually pubescent above).
The leaves are simple, alternate, glabrous or pubescent on the veins of the lower face, have a relatively long petiole (about 10 cm), sometimes longer than the blade, and an oval to rhomboid oblong shaped blade, from 2 to 8 cm long by 1.5 to 6 cm wide, with rounded apex, slightly mucronate.
The relatively dense inflorescences consist of slender spikes up to 12 cm long grouped in terminal or axillary panicles. The tiny flowers are pollinated by the wind. Green in color often tinged with red, they are unisexual (monoecious plant), male (staminate flowers) or female (pistillate flowers), the latter being more numerous. The perianth is formed by three oblong tepals about 1.5 mm long, . The male flowers, often at the end of the inflorescences, almost unnoticed, have three stamens. The female flowers have a superior, unilocular ovary surmounted by 2 or 3 short stigmas. The bracts of the female flowers, oval to lanceolate, are shorter than the tepals.
The fruits are almost globose indehiscent capsules, about 1.25 to 1.75 mm in diameter, containing a single seed. These fruits are strongly wrinkled, a characteristic which makes it possible to distinguish this species of Amaranthus blitum with ellipsoid fruits which are generally smooth or slightly wrinkled8,9.
Seeds rounded, slightly compressed, shiny, brown to black in color with a lighter edge, have a diameter of 1 to 1.25 mm. The seedling with epigeal germination shows lanceolate cotyledons about 12 mm long.
