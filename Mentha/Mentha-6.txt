Mint Plants Used for Cooking

Native to the Mediterranean, members of the mint (Mentha spp.) family are tough, unfussy perennial herbs. The diverse aromas and flavors of mint make the plants especially useful in the kitchen where you can use them to flavor a variety of foods and beverages. Plant mint carefully, as the rambunctious plants tend to become invasive.

Peppermint

- Peppermint (Mentha x peperita) is used to flavor many foods, including hot and cold drinks, desserts, salads and meats. The plant, which reaches 36 inches at maturity, has dark green leaves, which sometimes take on a purple tint, and spiky, purple flowers. Peppermint includes varieties such as "Chocolate" mint (Mentha x piperita "Chocolate") and orange mint (Mentha x piperita "Citrata"), both of which are used mostly in beverages and desserts. Peppermint grows in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 4 through 9.

Spearmint

- Spearmint (Mentha spicata) has spiky, pale blue flowers and dark green leaves that are slightly smaller than peppermint leaves. The plant grows to 12 to 36 inches tall. Spearmint is used in vegetable, meat and fish dishes, sauces, cold beverages, jellies and candies. Hardy in USDA zones 3 through 11, spearmint draws honeybees and other beneficial insects to the garden.

Apple Mint

- Apple mint (Mentha suaveolens) has a milder aroma than peppermint and is reminiscent of both apples and mint. The plant, which reaches mature heights of 1 to 2 feet, has fuzzy, grayish-green leaves and spiky purplish-white blooms. The variegated apple mint (Mentha suaveolens "Variegata") has a pineapple scent and white-marked leaves. Both work well in salads, sauces, vegetable dishes and jellies, and both grow in USDA zones 5 through 9.

Ginger Mint

- Also known as red mint or bushy mint, ginger mint (Mentha x gracilis) produces upright, red-tinted stems and slightly wrinkled, sword-shaped leaves. The blossoms, which grow in whorled clusters, are pale purple. The leaves, which have a fruity flavor, are incorporated into vegetable dishes, fresh fruit dishes, salads, baked goods, vinaigrettes and soups. The plant, which reaches 24 to 36 inches tall, is perennial in USDA zones 6 through 9.

Orange Mint

- Orange mint (Mentha aquatica), also known as watermint, is a semi-aquatic plant with dark green leaves and small lavender flowers. Because of its citrusy flavor, orange mint is often used to flavor fresh fruits, especially apricots, peaches and nectarines, as well as preserves, desserts and beverages. Because the flavor is so strong, use this mint sparingly. Orange mint, which grows 24 to 36 inches tall, grows in USDA zones 6 through 9.
