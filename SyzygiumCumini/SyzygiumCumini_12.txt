Jamun (Syzygium cumini L. Skeels): A Promising Fruit for the Future 

Summary

Jamun (Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels) is an evergreen tropical tree whose fruit is used for both fresh consumption and processing. The tree is relatively drought tolerant and is grown and utilized in many tropical regions. However, the fruit is very perishable and not widely marketed around the world. Jamun fruit contains high levels of antioxidants and phenolic compounds, which have a number of reported human health benefits. While the fruit has a short postharvest life at ambient temperatures, storage life can be extended with the use of appropriate postharvest treatments, such as refrigeration. However, limited postharvest research has been conducted on jamun fruit. This review includes coverage of the plant's botany, fruit nutritional value, physicochemical properties, and changes to the fruit quality after harvest. In addition, appropriate postharvest treatments for maintaining fruit quality during storage, transport, and marketing are reviewed. The development of jamun fruit as a commercial fruit in world trade will rely on the further development and adoption of cultivars with good quality, and proper postharvest management practices and storage techniques. Future research strategies to improve the knowledge and use of jamun fruit are proposed, with emphases on the health benefits of the fruit and the mechanisms involved in fruit ripening.
