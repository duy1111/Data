Jambolan (Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels): A review on its nutrients, bioactive compounds and health benefits

Abstract
Jambolan is a colored fruit that varies from yellowish-green to black, from the Myrtaceae family and the Syzygieae tribe. this review proposes a general view regarding the nutritional and health benefits aspects, and the health benefits of the main components of jambolan fruit. The fruit has attracted the attention of the food industry because of its color and high sugar content. Phytochemicals levels stood out, especially the levels of anthocyanins, which tend to increase from 28.5 to 1318.4 mg/100 g during ripening. Studies report the presence of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin in the pulp and peel of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels. There were reports of the presence of lutein, zeaxanthin, β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin in the fruit. This work was the first to propose a possible pathway for carotenoid biosynthesis in S. cumini with the available data. Additionally, several studies have associated the consumption of S. cumini with antidiabetic, hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective effects.
