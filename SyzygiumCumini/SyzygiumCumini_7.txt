Jamun (Syzygium cumini (L.)): A Review of Its Food and Medicinal Uses

1. Introduction
Syzygium cumini (Family Myrtaceae) is also known as
Syzygium jambolanum and Eugenia cumini. Other com-
mon names are Jambul, Black Plum, Java Plum, Indian
Blackberry, Jamblang, Jamun etc. Today these trees are
found growing throughout the Asian subcontinent, East-
ern Africa, South America, Madagascar and have also
naturalized to Florida and Hawaii in the United States of
America [1]. The tree fruits once in a year and the berries
are sweetish sour to taste. The ripe fruits are used for
health drinks, making preserves, squashes, jellies and
wine [1]. In association to its dietary use, all parts of the
tree and, importantly the seeds are used to treat a range
of ailments, the most important being diabetes mellitus
[2]. Different parts of the jambolan were also reported for
its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuropsycho-phar-
macological, anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-HIV, an-
tileishmanial and antifugal, nitric oxide scavenging, free
radical scavenging, anti-diarrheal, antifertility, anorexi-
genic, gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic and redio-
protective activities [2]. (Figure 1) shows the Jamun
fruit.

fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic), starch
(41%), dextrin (6.1%), a trace of phytosterol, and 6 to
19% tannin [5]. The fruits are avidly eaten by birds and
four footed animals (jackals and civets in India). In Aus-
tralia, they are a favorite food of the large bat called
“flying fox”. Analyses of the leaves show: crude protein
(9.1%), fat (4.3%), crude fiber (17.0%), ash (6.0%), cal-
cium (1.3%), phosphorus (0.19%) [6]. It consists mainly
of mono- or sesqui-terpene hydrocarbons which are
“very common in essential oils.” Constituents of Syzgium
cumini seeds are fatty oils (30 g/kg), including lauric
(2.8%), myristic (31.7%), palmitic (4.7%), stearic (6.5%),
oleic (32.2%), linoleic (16.1%), malvalic (1.2%), stercu-
lic (1.8%) and vernolic acid (3%) and phytosterols such
as β-sitosterol. Further constituents are tannins (6%),
predominantly corilagin, ellagitannins, ellagic acid, gal-
loyl-galactoside and gallic acid [7]. The leaf oil consists

3. Food Uses
Good quality jambolan juice is excellent for sherbet [11,
12], syrup and “squash”. In India the latter is a bottled
drink prepared by cooking the crushed fruits for 5 to 10
minutes at 140 ̊F, pressing out the juice, combining it
with sugar and water and adding citric acid and sodium
benzoate as a preservative [13]. Jambolans of good size
and quality, having a sweet or sub acid flavor and a
minimum of astringency, are enjoyable raw and may be
made into tarts [14], sauces and jam. Astringent fruits are
improved in palatability by soaking them in salt water
[14] or pricking them, rubbing them with a little salt, and
letting them stand for an hour [15]. All but decidedly in
ferior fruits can be utilized for juice which is often com-
parable to grape juice [16]. When extracting juice from
cooked jambolans, it is recommended that it be allowed
to drain out without squeezing the fruit and it will thus be
less as tringent. The white-fleshed jambolan has adequate
pectin and makes a very stiff jelly unless cooking is brief
[17]. The more common purplefleshed yields richly col-
ored jelly [18] but is deficient in pectin and requires the
addition of a commercial jelling agent or must be com-
bined with pectin-rich fruits such as unripe or sour gua-
vas, or ketembillas [18]. In Goa and the Philippines [19],
jambolans are an important source of wine, resembling
Port [20]. Brandy and a distilled liquor called “jambava”
have also been made from the fermented fruit. Jambolan
vinegar, extensively made throughout India, is an attrac-
tive, clear purple, with a pleasant aroma and mild flavor.
4. Uses in Traditional Medicine
Traditionally the jambul fruits, leaves, seeds, and bark
are all used in ayurvedic medicine. The bark contains
tannins and carbohydrates, accounting for its long-term
use as an astringent to combat ailments like dysentery
[21]. A glycoside in the seed, jamboline, is considered to
have antidiabetic properties [22]. Older French research
shows that the seeds have a significant hypoglycemic
effect in diabetic rabbits [23]. The seeds have also shown
anti-inflammatory effects in rats and antioxidant proper-

ties in diabetic rat [24]. Older reports from Indian medi-
cal journals suggest jambul seed and bark can be benefi-
cial in humans with diabetes [25]. Jamun fruit seeds and
pulp have been reported to serve various purposes in
diabetic patients, such as lowering blood glucose levels
and delaying diabetic complications including neuropa-
thy and cataracts [2,26]. Jamun is most often recognized
as an adjuvant therapy in type-2 diabetes. This has been
traced not only to its anthocyanin-rich, dark-purple fle-
shy pulp, but also to its seeds, which have been most
studied for their antidiabetic principles. Jamun seeds are
reported to be a rich source of ellagitannins (ETs), in-
cluding corilagin, 3,6-hexa hydroxyl diphenoyl glucose
and its isomer 4,6-hexahydroxy diphenoyl glucose, 1-
galloylglucose, 3-galloylglucose, gallic acid, and ellagic
acid (EA) [26]. This marker compound has anti-diabetic
activity. When alloxan induced diabetic rats were fed
with Jamun seed extract, the blood glucose, blood urea,
serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels were
found to decrease significantly [27]. Jamun fruit reduces
the sugar in the blood and is very good in the control of
diabetes. Its seeds contain Glucoside, Jamboline and El-
lagic acid, which are reported to have the ability to check
the conversion of starch into sugar in case of excess pro-
duction of glucose [27]. All parts of the jambolan can be
used medicinally and it has a long tradition in alternative
medicine. The plant has been viewed as an antidiabetic
plant since it became commercially available several
decades ago.
From all over the word, the fruits have been used for a
wide variety of ailments, including cough, diabetes, dys-
entery, inflammation and ringworm [28]. It is also an
ancient medicinal plant with an illustrious medical his-
tory and has been the subject of classical reviews for
over 100 years. It is widely distributed throughout India
and Ayurvedic medicine (Indian folk medicine) mentions
its use for the treatment of diabetic mellitus. Various
traditional practitioners in India use the different parts of
the plant in the treatment of diabetes, blisters in mouth,
cancer, colic, and diarrhea, digestive complaints, dysen-
tery, piles, pimples and stomachache [29]. During last
four decades, numerous folk medicinal reports on the
antidiabetic effects of this plant have been cited in the
literature. In Union medicine various parts of Jambolan
acts as liver tonic, enrich blood, strengthen teeth and
gums and form Good lotion for removing ringworm in-
fection of the head [30].
E. jambolana leaf extract showed hypoglycemic action
in diabetic rats [30]. The seed powder of E. jambolana is
reported to have hypoglycemic action in streptozotocin-
diabetic rats [31,32]. Its effect may be persistent, as in
one study, homeostasis was maintained in the rats for
two weeks after the cessation of treatment [32]. In al-
loxan-diabetic rabbits the water extract of E. jambolana
fruit pulp was more effective than the ethanol extract at
reducing fasting blood glucose and improving blood
glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test. E. jambolana
also increased blood insulin levels in both diabetic and
severely diabetic rabbits [33,34]. The inhibition of insu-
linase activity from liver and kidney by extract of
Eugenia jambolana also has been reported, which points
out to its extra-pancreatic mechanism [34]. Another
study also found that E. jambolana seed extract reduced
blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and increased
plasma insulin [35]. E. jambolana fruit combined with
bitter melon decreased insulin levels that were raised in
diabetic rats fed a fructose diet [36].
Jamun is most often recognized as an adjuvant therapy
in type-2 diabetes. This has been traced not only to its
anthocyanin-rich, dark-purple fleshy pulp, but also to its
seeds, which have been most studied for their antidia-
betic principles. Other reports from Indian medical jour-
nals suggest jambul seed and bark can be beneficial in
humans with diabetes [37]. When alloxan induced dia-
betic rats were fed with Jamun seed extract, the blood
glucose, blood urea, serum cholesterol and serum triglyc-
eride levels were found to decrease significantly [27].
Jamun fruit reduces the sugar in the blood and is very
good in the control of diabetes.
Ayurvedic texts suggest that 1 - 3 g of seed powder per
day is an average dose 44 additionally, Juice of ripe fruits
in the amount of 0.5 - 2 tsp (2.5 - 10 ml) at least three
times daily have been recommended for the treatment of
diabetes. Administration of 100 and 200 mg/kg body
weight of aqueous extract of Syzygium cumini pulp sig-
nificantly decreased the blood glucose level in the ex-
perimental rats suggesting that it has hypoglycemic prop-
erties. The decreased body weight in diabetic rats is due
to excessive breakdown of tissue proteins. Treatment
with Syzygium cumini improved body weight signifi-
cantly in a dose dependent manner, indicating prevention
of muscle wasting due to hyperglycemic condition.
5. Medicinal Properties
The jambolan has received far more recognition in folk
medicine and in the pharmaceutical trade than in any
other field. Medicinally, the fruit is stated to be astringent,
stomachic, carminative, antiscorbutic and diuretic [37].
Additionally, a fruit extract showed antimicrobial and
cytotoxic activities and may potentially be used on topi-
cal antimicrobial products. In comparison to other non-
traditional fruits jambolao showed considerable high
antioxidant activity, which can constituent such as an-
thocyanins, tannins and flavonols [38]. The anthocyanin
composition was characterised by the presence of 3,5-
diglucosides of five out of six aglycones commonly found
in foods [39]. Fruits contain many different kinds of
