Propagation and pot size 
Ficus auriculata can also be grown from cuttings. Cutting and planting the branches of a fresh, healthy tree is how it is done. However, the process may take a while for the cuttings to mature. Therefore you must have patience. Place a fresh plant firmly four to six inches away from the soil surface or plastic-based planter. Replant the plant in a larger container if you bought it from a nursery. But make sure it has adequate drainage holes because they’ll help with good aeration and maintain the plant strong and thriving.
Requirements for growing Ficus Auriculata indoors


Location: Ficus auriculata can be planted all year round indoors, beside a sunny window, or outside during warmer climates. In the spring and summer, you can also put a Ficus bonsai on your balcony or backyard. The delicate leaves of the Ficus auriculata can often burn in the afternoon sun, which it favors in the morning. It may weaken from lack of light, leading to leaf drops, and doesn’t like cold winds, and they don’t appreciate sudden changes. 
Humidity: If you do not frequently use the heat or air conditioning and don’t live in a humid area, you might want to put this plant on a moisture plate or have a humidifier nearby. If you reside in a humid environment, you may set your Ficus auriculata outside in direct sunlight when the temperature consistently rises over 30 degrees.
Soil mixture: It takes effort to prepare the soil and pot for this plant properly. Before it needs to be transferred, your Ficus auriculata bonsai soil must be able to remain in its original container for at least some months.
Watering: Watering is crucial for Ficus auriculata trees since they are housed in tiny pots, where the air dries up much more quickly than it does for plants in the land or larger pots. Monitor your tree every day. Finding the right balance between insufficient and too much water might be difficult, but it is essential. When your tree needs water, give them a chance to catch their breath before giving them another good soak. When the soil has started to feel a little dry, that’s the ideal moment to water this plant. Whenever the time comes, water sparingly but deeply. It won’t suffocate your tree and will allow appropriate moisture absorption into the soil.
Fertilising: A half-strength chemical fertilizer or an organic liquid fertiliser is required for Ficus auriculata. Throughout the growing season, bonsai fertilisers should be applied often and consistently (March to September). In the Winter, fertilize once a month. Fertilising is recommended in the Ficus bonsai care manual because it responds quickly and ardently to needs.
 

How to care for Ficus Auriculata? 
Repotting: As it absorbs all the nutrients in the soil, roots will gradually shape themselves to resemble the shape of the pot. Nutrient deficiencies and overcrowding can have severe effects. Therefore, repotting is necessary. You should report your plant every three years if they are flourishing. However, 4-5 years is certainly long enough under normal circumstances. If the root ball is well-rooted, it may be repotted.
Pruning: The top and exterior borders of plant bonsai kinds grow the fastest to compete with other shrubs for exposure. By pruning, we may control plant growth and produce a more aesthetically pleasing shape. The Ficus auriculata proliferates. It is advised to cut back to about two leaves for every six grown. Make use of scissors or clippers made specifically for bonsai.
Pests and Diseases: Ficus auriculata is prone to a few peculiar and common diseases. Scales are the most typical insect that infects this plant. Scale typically appears as brown or black pimples on the branches. These bumps contain insects that are shielded by a waxy shell. The sticky substance that stains the components could also be present. Mealybugs appear at the base of the leaf as whitish cottony spots, and some infestations target the roots. These are poisonous to insecticides that contain malathion. Most figs may easily take
dormant oil at one tablespoon per gallon. One can treat the root meals with oil. Systemic poisoning will be necessary to combat this infestation.
