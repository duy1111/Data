Ficus auriculata Plant Detail

Description
Roxburgh Fig is a wide spreading evergreen tree found in moist, lowland tropics.  This tree that is often found growing along stream banks may have more than one trunk.  Although it is classified as an evergreen, it can be deciduous during extended periods of cold temperatures.  The optimum growing temperatures range from 60 to 75 degrees, however it will tolerate a range from 55 to 90 degrees.  Temperatures below 30 degrees may severely damage or kill the plant.

Its name comes from the founder of Indian botany, Sir William Roxburgh.  Auricle is Latin for ear, referring to the two ears at the base of heart shaped leaf.  

Its fruit is edible and often harvested from the wild.   The fruits form as large clusters on the trunk, on branches and on the roots.  It is not uncommon to discover a tree where the base is covered with hundreds of fruits.  They can be eaten raw or cooked, used in jams, juice and curries.  

New growth is a deep coppery-red color that will mature to green.

The large leaves, often up to 21" long and 12" wide are used as plates.

Like most figs, it relies on a single specialized species of wasp for fertilization.  That wasp is also dependent on that fig species for breeding.  Three types of flowers are produced, male, long-style female and short-style female (gall flower).  A female wasp enters a fig and lays its eggs on the short-style flowers, while at the same time pollinating the long-style flowers.  The male wasp (wingless) emerge and inseminates the female while boring exit tunnels for the females.  The females collect pollen as they emerge, in search of figs that have receptive flowers.  

Insects, Diseases, and Other Plant Problems:  The fruit can be messy.  Its branches are weak, keeping the plant small will help with this trait.  Susceptible to scale.  Minor issues with gall, mealy bugs, thrips, whitefly, and spider mite.
