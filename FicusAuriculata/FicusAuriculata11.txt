How to grow Ficus auriculata growing and care:
Well drain soil, mulch (especially when the plant young)

How to care:
Prune once a year, fertilize 4 time a year (when the tree is young more nitrogen), cover the soil in mulch, add humus and organic matter

What is the best way to start growing?
Plant / Seed (explanation bellow) / Vegetative Reproduction – cutting

How to propagate by cutting:
Propagation by cutting, when start from branch need to choose brown branch fully grown use root growth hormone that fit for woody branches, need to keep high humidity, moist soil and if put it in close box or greenhouse, need to be well ventilate that will moving of the air, watering by spraying or create fog and take care don’t let it dry

Is it necessary to graft or use vegetative reproduction?
Yes, it’s grow faster from cutting and can ensure the quality of the fruits, although it’s not hard from seeds

Difficulties or problems when growing:
Irritant skin

Planting season:
Spring in hardiness zone 9, spring to summer in hardiness zone 10a, spring to autumn in hardiness zone 10b, all year in hardiness zone 11

How to plant:
Dig a hole as deep bigger than the current root ball plus extra 70-100%, put in the hole organic matter, hummus and dried leaves and mix it with the soil, reduce the hole to size of the roots ball, put the tree and loos little bit the root ball above the hole, when the plant in dormant possible to cut part of the root and prune the tree, plant the tree and cover it and don’t push the soil too much strong but not too much lightly because it won’t be stable, over with mulch to keep moist on soil, put water, for the next two weeks put every day (better in the morning), and if the temperature above 30C (86F) increase the amount of water.

Pests and diseases:
Batocera rufomaculata, gall, scales, mealy bugs, thrips, whitefly, spider mite

Pruning season:
Winter, possible all the year, better after the fruits

How to prune:
Weak branches, recommend keeping the tree small

Size of the plant?
10-20m, 30-60 feet, possible to grow as dwarf 2-5m (6-15 inches)

Growth speed in optimal condition:
Fast growing / Medium growing

Water requirement:
Small amount of water / Average amount of water, the plant likes water but can grow with small amount of water it will affect the fruits and the size, too much water in the fruits season will attract a lot of pests

Light conditions in optimal condition for growing:
Full Sun / Half Shade (grow better in full sun) usually growing in half shade when the plant young and the plant will get the sun when older

Is it possible to grow indoor as houseplant?
No

Growing is also possible in a planter /flowerpot / containers:
Yes, when grow in container need to limit the growth of the plant and grow it as dwarf or bonsai need to limit the growth of the roots, container need to be 50% bigger than the root ball until the plant arrive to the desirable container, wouldn’t recommend to start from big container on small tree in this method it’s care for the viability of the soil, minimum size of the container 25-50L (5-10 gallons) and bigger is better, making enough holes in the container for good drainage also choosing soil for container important an option it’s to use potting mix or peat soil with perlite and organic matter, care instruction every few years to switch the soil with big container there is no need to switch all the soil just switch part and cut some of the roots ball (can switch from the side and the top, fertilizer at least once a year, need to add humus few better twice, water it regularly and when put bottom for the pot be aware not to let the water stay there more than one day and do not over water it’s destroy the soil and the roots, consider to graft in order to get good quality of fruits or start by cutting.
