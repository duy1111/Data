DESCRIPTION AND ETHNOBOTANY
Others - Plant Morphology	Small, non-strangling fig tree, with widely-spreading crown, low branching and short stout trunk. Injured surfaces produce cream-coloured latex. Leaves large (30x30cm), heart-shaped, prominently-veined, hairy underneath; young leaves pinkish-brown.Fleshy fruit-like structures (synconiums) produced in clusters directly on basal branches and trunk -- a phenomenon known as cauliflory. Synconiums large and hollow, bearing numerous tiny flowers on inner wall. Wild forms are divided into gall trees (male and gall flowers in same fig) and seed trees (female flowers), which are pollinated by fig wasps. Cultivated forms apparently parthenogenic, produce only female figs and are not visited by wasps. Synconiums ripen from reddish-brown to speckled reddish-purple, becoming fragrant, sweet and edible upon maturity.Likes well-drained soils rich in organic matter. Eye-catching large leaves make tree suitable as specimen plant in parks and large gardens. Species epithet 'auriculata' (meaning ear-like) describes shape of leaves or scales around fig's opening (ostiole).
