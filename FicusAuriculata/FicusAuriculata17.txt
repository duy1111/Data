Ficus auriculata: Propagation at Malesiana Tropicals, Bau, Kuching

Ficus auriculata  at the Malesiana Tropicals Sdn Bhd plant nursery at Bau near Kuching.
Note that Ficus auriculata is not native to Borneo but is sometimes grown in home orchards. The figs are edible and sweet. The variety grown in Borneo is believed to be a parthenocarpic variety which cannot produce viable seeds and therefore  must be propagated via cuttings.

Malesiana Tropicals hosts the Rescuing Borneo Project  which is growing a  large variety of native tree saplings. These young trees will be used to restore forest in Borneo which has been damaged by logging or swidden farming.  At least 40 species of native Bornean figs are being grown,  some of them very rare.
