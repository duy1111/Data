Azadirachta indica
Azadirachta indica (bead tree, pride of China, margosa, neem or nim tree, holy tree, indiar, lilac tree) contains a variety of steroids, sesquiterpenoids, ester terpenoids, tetranortriterpenoids, and triterpenoids. Bark extracts of the neem tree have been used to treat peptic ulcers [1]. Neem oil is larvicidal against mosquitoes [2], and neem seed extracts are pesticidal [3] and have been used in the treatment of head lice [4].
Margosa oil, a long chain fatty acid that is extracted from the seeds of the neem tree, has been reported to have caused a toxic encephalopathy, with vomiting, drowsiness, tachypnea and recurrent generalised seizures, leukocytosis and a metabolic acidosis [5,6]. It has also been implicated as a potential cause of Reye’s syndrome in 13 infants, who developed vomiting, drowsiness, metabolic acidosis, a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, and encephalopathy within hours of taking margosa oil; liver biopsy in one infant showed pronounced fatty infiltration of the liver [7,8]. In experimental animals given margosa oil there was also fatty infiltration of the proximal renal tubules and cerebral edema. Electron microscopy showed mitochondrial damage.
Natural Products and Cancer Signaling: Isoprenoids, Polyphenols and Flavonoids
Siddavaram Nagini, in The Enzymes, 2014
Abstract
Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is one of the most versatile medicinal plants, widely distributed in the Indian subcontinent. Neem is a rich source of limonoids that are endowed with potent medicinal properties predominantly antioxidant, anti inflammatory, and anticancer activities. Azadirachtin, gedunin, and nimbolide are more extensively investigated relative to other neem limonoids. Accumulating evidence indicates that the anticancer effects of neem limonoids are mediated through the inhibition of hallmark capabilities of cancer such as cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion, inflammation, invasion, and angiogenesis. The neem limonoids have been demonstrated to target oncogenic signaling kinases and transcription factors chiefly, NF κB, Wnt/  catenin, PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Neem limonoids that target multiple pathways that are aberrant in cancer are ideal candidates for cancer chemoprevention and therapy.Neem Extract

Neem Extract as a Nutraceutical
Besides a wide range of activities of the neem leaf, including antibacterial, anticarcinogenic, antifungal, antihyperglycemic, anti inflammatory, antimalarial, antimutagenic, antioxidant, antiulcer, antiviral, and immunomodulatory, chewing fresh leaves acts as a sedative and relaxant. Aqueous extract of neem leaves shows noteworthy antiulcer activity and reduction in severity of gastric injury, and prevents mast cell degranulation and mucus depletion. Neem leaves are quite prosperous in nutritious elements as compared to any other similar vegetation that has been subjected to chemical analysis. Neem leaf chutney was a regular feature of Mahatma Gandhi’s diet. A nutraceutical tea now being manufactured would indisputably have been Gandhi’s favorite drink. Neem can also be blended with green tea or black tea for a milder taste. The neem leaf extract has also been reported to be advantageous in the treatment of carbon tetrachloride–induced liver damage (Mujumdar et al., 1998).
In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, neem is always mixed with other herbs to augment its efficacy and to make its taste more palatable. Herbs good for the pitta dosha such as licorice, honey, sugar, lemon juice, and/or spices like cardamom may be used to amplify the efficacy or to reduce the side effects. The bitterness can also be counterbalanced with herbs and spices like cinnamon, orange peel, licorice root, and fennel seed. Neem has been indicated in contemporary Ayurveda for diabetes mellitus, perhaps by enhancing the insulin receptor sensitivity. Oral administration of leaf extract has been found to significantly reduce insulin requirements for noninsulin dependent diabetes patients. An active principle, Nimbidiol, which is present in root and bark, can inhibit intestinal glucosidases, and thus can be helpful in controlling diabetes (Mukherjee and Sengupta, 2013). Fresh mature leaves, along with the seeds of Psoralea corglifolia and Cicer arietinum, are effective in leucoderma. Tender leaves, along with black pepper, are effective in intestinal helminthic infections.
A mature neem tree can produce 300–400 kg leaves per year, which may be used for feeding cattle during famine. Deoiled seeds may be used as fertilizer or as unconventional animal feed. Neem seed cake is a good source of protein (30–40% crude protein) for livestock; there are approximately 0.9 million tons available in India (Singh, 1993). Its protein is relatively balanced in its amino acid content and mineral profile (Gowda and Sastry, 2000), and it has tremendous potential to compensate for protein supplement shortages in the livestock industry. The neem seed is readily available in northeast India and perhaps in parts of Asia, the northern part of Nigeria, Australia, Africa, and Central and South America.
Although immunostimulants are known to trigger body immunity, their regular consumption may cause intolerance because of overstimulation of the immune system, disrupting the normal metabolic processes in the body. Supplementation of specific immunostimulants in feed can improve animal health and thereby reduce management costs. Among immunostimulants, neem leaf can be used as a feed additive to replace the antibiotic and/or disinfectant to develop a new concept of organic biotechnology for sustainable aquaculture. The therapeutic potential of the neem leaf as a dietary supplement improves the nonspecific immunity of fish. Dietary doses of neem leaf significantly influenced the immune parameters, hematological parameters, and blood biochemical indices and increased survival rate in Lates calcarifer fingerlings against Vibrio harveyi infection. It increased phagocytic activity, superoxide anion production, serum lysozyme, serum bactericidal activity, and serum antiprotease activity of treated fish (Talpur and Ikhwanuddin, 2013).
Feeding neem kernel cakes without treatment has been shown to have a negative impact on nutrient digestibility and performance of ruminants. Poor palatability, reduced weight gain, and lower nutrient digestibility were observed in cross bred calves fed concentrated mixtures containing neem seed cake (Bedi et al., 1975). Lowered rumen protozoan count and reduced enzyme activity have been reported in calves fed neem kernel cake (Mondal et al., 1995), suggesting reduction in rumen digestibility. Poor growth has also been recorded in adult cattle when 27% of the protein requirement in the diet was provided through neem seed cake (Pradhan, 1975).
Overnight soaking of neem kernel cake in 0.8% sodium hydroxide and water followed by washing with water two or three times leads to significantly higher nitrogen balance (Nath et al., 1983). In addition, cattle productivity remained unaffected qualitatively as well as quantitatively. There was no significant variation in milk yield, milk fat content, sensory evaluation of milk, dry matter intake, and digestibility when treated neem kernel cake was incorporated at a level of 40% in the concentrated diet of dairy cows for 300 days (Nath et al., 1989).
The palatability of neem seed cake can be improved with appropriate treatment to remove the bioactive principles or by feeding along with barley, molasses, and peanut meal, but reduced consumption (from 79% to 39%) of the concentrated mixture may result when neem seed cake levels are increased from 59% to 90% (Bhandari and Joshi, 1974). Yearling sheep can completely utilize concentrate mixture with 75 parts neem seed cake and 25 parts maize, but their feed consumption reduces to one third if neem seed cake is fed alone (Gupta and Bhaid, 1980). Buffalo calves continued to consume neem seed cake after its proportion was increased from 5 to 15 parts when fed along with 7 parts of molasses and 20 parts of peanut meal; the overall feed consumption reduced to half following the withdrawal of molasses (Baxi, 1976).
Inclusion of neem seed cake is economical in ruminant farming. Urea ammoniated neem seed kernel meal has been proven to be a satisfactory, economical, and wholesome substitute for complete replacement of deoiled groundnut cake in rations of growing goats. Approximately 20% lower costs per weight gain have been reported when deoiled groundnut cake was replaced with urea ammoniated neem kernel meal in goats (Baxi, 1976).
A growth trial was undertaken to study the feasibility of total replacement of deoiled groundnut cake (DGNC) by urea ammoniated neem seed kernel meal (UANSKM) on the basis of nutritive value, biochemical parameters, and feeding economics (Anandan et al., 1996). Dietary variation did not significantly influence the efficiency of dry matter (8.7 vs 9.1 g DM), crude protein (1.2 vs 1.2 g CP), and metabolic energy (22.9 vs 22.8 kcal ME) utilization per unit gain. The total body weight gain (kg), average daily gain (g), and feed conversion efficiency (feed/gain) in the experimental group were 5.6±0.59, 31.0±3.25, and 9.1±0.57, respectively, as compared to the corresponding values of 6.0±0.56, 32.8±3.20, and 8.7±0.55, respectively, in the DGNC group. The hematobiochemical profile (hemoglobin, glucose, and urea nitrogen) and the activity of various enzymes (transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) did not differ significantly between the treatments, but the feed cost per kilogram gain of the UANSKM diet was cheaper than that of DGNC diet by 14.2%. The feeding cost per unit weight gain and average daily gain in males was marginally superior to that in females. Glucose concentrations were higher (P < 0.01) in males, whereas other blood constituents did not differ between the sexes.
With a ban on four commonly used feed antibiotic growth promoters monensin, salinomycin, avilamycin, and flavophospholipol by the European Commission, neem leaf meal (NLM) may be a useful ingredient in the diet of broilers as a medicinal and nutritional element (Bonsu et al., 2012), but the inclusion level varies with age and physiological status. Neem and Ocimum sanctum (tulsi) leaves extract activate the cell mediated immune response, therefore, creating an enhanced response to any future challenges due to disease organisms. The feeding of neem and tulsi leaves to immunosuppressed poultry birds increases their humoral and cell mediated immune responses (Sadekar et al., 1998). A low dose of neem leaf extract has an inhibitory action on a wide spectrum of microorganisms. A 4% infusion of neem leaves at a concentration of 50 mL per liter of fresh drinking water could be effectively used as a potential natural growth promoter and as an immune stimulant, contributing to better body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, gross return, lower mortality, and higher antibody titer against infectious bursal disease (Durrani et al., 2008).
The proximate composition of neem leaf meal indicated that it is a good source of protein, with crude protein values ranging from 18.10% to 20.68%. The maximum tolerance level of neem leaf meal as a protein source described in the literature is 10% in starter broilers and 15% in laying birds and rabbits, although it contains bioactive compounds such as azadirachtin, nimbin, salanin, limonoids, and tannin that may affect nutrient utilization (Aruwayo and Maigandi, 2013). The bioactive toxic principles may be reduced by sun drying. The only concern in this regard is its acceptability, because of its pungent smell and bitterness due to the bioactive principles. Despite high crude protein content, its incorporation in animal diets was discouraged due to the presence of bitter and toxic triterpenoids, mainly nimbin, nimbidin, azadirachtin, and salanin (Paul et al., 1996). Furthermore, feeding such ingredients may impart an unpleasant taste or smell to meat (Clausen et al., 1985). Removal of these bitter phytoconstituents through solvent extraction, water washing, alkali soaking, and urea ammoniation has gained appreciable success in improving the acceptability (Gowda and Sastry, 2000). In addition, the palatability and utilization of such unconventional feedstuffs can be further improved by incorporating them in complete diets and processing into pellets (Reddy and Reddy, 1999).
Efficacy
Neem leaves are considered safe to be taken internally on a regular basis. Neem is one of the most powerful blood purifiers and detoxifiers in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Neem leaves relieve the symptoms associated with viral infections, including common cold, herpes, influenza, and chickenpox. Eating neem leaves reduces fever associated with viral infection. Neem leaves also contain phospholipase A2 inhibitor, which can be used as a snake venom inhibitor.
Fusarium is a filamentous fungi widely distributed in soil. Several species of Fusarium produce mycotoxins such as trichothecenes and zearalenone in cereal crops that are used as animal and poultry feed and can affect human and animal health if they enter the food chain. Zearalenone triggers reproductive disorders, including hyperestrogenic syndromes and tumor production, whereas trichothecenes are sesquiterpenoid epoxides that act as potent inhibitors of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Neem oil extract decreases zearalenone production at 0.1–0.5% concentrations, but the highest inhibition (59.05%) of mycotoxin synthesis occurred at 0.1% (Geraldo et al., 2011).
Neem Leaf Glycoprotein in Cancer Immunomodulation and Immunotherapy
Anamika Bose, Rathindranath Baral, in New Look to Phytomedicine, 2019
Abstract
Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a well known tree with immense medicinal properties and is the most versatile medicinal plant having a wide spectrum of biological activity. A group from Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India identified a glycoprotein in an aqueous preparation from neem leaves and it has several immunomodulatory functions, detrimental for tumor growth. The glycoprotein is designated as neem leaf glycoprotein or NLGP and preclinical studies established NLGP as a therapeutic tool for eradication and/or sustained restriction of murine tumor growth, based on several evidences in favor of possible multifaceted antitumor therapeutic benefits. First, NLGP rectifies immune evasion strategies that ultimately licenses better CD8+ T cell mediated tumor killing. NLGP polarizes type 1 immune microenvironment over regulatory microenvironment. NLGP reduces frequency and suppressive properties of regulatory immune cells (Tregs, myeloid derived suppressor cells, tumor associated macrophages) within tumor microenvironment (TME). It also inhibits indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase to maintain optimum tryptophan supply to T cells. As a vaccine adjuvant, it promotes central and effector memory cells in lymph node and spleen respectively to induce sustained tumor growth restriction. Besides, NLGP regulates hypoxia within TME and promotes vascular normalization by targeting hypoxia inducing factor 1 alpha mediated vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. NLGP impedes the metastatic tumor growth in distant organs. A unique immunomodulation on host immune system by NLGP to restrain malignant growth definitely establishes NLGP as a candidate cancer drug.

Neem extract
Neem (Azadirachta indica), an evergreen tree of India, belongs to the plant family Meliaceae (mahogany). It has been recognized as one of the most promising sources of compounds with insect control, antimicrobial and medicinal properties [18]. In India, neem has been in use since ancient times as a traditional medicine against various human ailments and about 700 herbal preparations based on neem are found in Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Amchi and other local health prescriptions. Neem has also received a lot of attention worldwide for its potential use as an herbal pesticide and other healthcare formulations in countries such as China, USA, France, Germany, Italy etc. The medicinal value of neem has been recognized by the US National Academy of Science who published a report in 1992 entitled, “Neem–A Tree of Solving Global Problem”.
The active ingredients of neem are found in all parts of the tree but in general, seed, bark, leaves and roots are mostly used for extraction purpose. More than 300 different active compounds have been reported from different parts of neem tree but the most important limonoids are azadirachtin, salannin and nimbin [19]. The neem extract has been widely used in herbal pesticide formulations because of its pest repellent properties. It should be mentioned that the active ingredients of neem extract is also used to inhibit the growth of Gram Positive and Gram negative bacteria.
Currently, little work has been published on the application of neem in textiles as an antimicrobial agent. Few patents based on the application of neem oil by micro encapsulation technique have been recently reported [20]. A systematic study on integrating neem seed and bark extracts on to the textile substrates has been undertaken by our group at IIT Delhi in the last five years [21], and the major findings are described briefly in this paper.

Use of Ayurvedic Medicinal Plants as Immunomodulators in Geriatrics

15.2.6 Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Family Meliaceae)
Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) is arguably the most useful traditional medicinal plant in India, and almost all parts of the tree are known to possess myriad medicinal uses in various traditional and folk systems of medicine. The aqueous preparation of neem leaves is shown to be effective in activating immune responses against tumor antigens. Studies in both mice and rats have shown that the extract, in combination with a breast tumor associated antigen, was effective in initiating a strong IgG response when compared to the response generated by the breast cancer associated antigen alone. This indicates that the extract is capable of enhancing immune responses to tumor vaccines. Additionally, the released IgG had the potential to mediate antibody dependent cellular toxicity and also initiated the cytotoxic T cell response. This process was aided by the secretion of IFN γ, which drove a Th1 response while decreasing IL 10, thereby mediating cytotoxicity. Furthermore, neem extract is non toxic and abundantly available, making it a cost effective immune enhancer in breast tumor associated antigen vaccine [18].
Gastroprotective Effects of Bioactive Foods

3.2 Bioactive Foods for Esophageal and Gastric Diseases
Neem (Azadiracta indica): Neem bark extract has shown potent antisecretory and antiulcer properties in animals and human (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2004; Maity et al., 2009; Malfertheiner et al., 2009). Lyophilized bark extract at 30 mg daily oral dose for 10 days significantly reduced gastric acid secretion in patients with chronic acid reflux and gastric ulcers. Further experiments are required to identify the bioactive compounds in neem bark extract.
Morinda citrifolia aqueous fruit extract: Morinda fruit (Noni fruit) extract containing the bioactive compound scopoletin showed antisecretory and antiulcer properties in rats (Mahattanadul et al., 2010).
Asparagus racemosus: Crude extract derived from Asparagus racemosus administered orally at 100 mg kg−1 reduced ulcers in rats that compared with the effects of Ranitidine, a current prescription drug. The extract also decreased gastric acid secretion (Bhatnagar and Sisodia, 2006).

3.3.4 Plant extract preparation
Neem trees were usually found in local areas. They were collected, washed with purified water, and dried with the help of filter paper. About 40 g of neem leaves were cut into small pieces with the knife that was sterilized with ethanol. Then, they were crushed with pestle and mortar and distributed in 80 mL of sterile sanitized water and 5–10 min heated at 70–80°C. Whatman's no. 1 channel paper was utilized to channel the concentrate, and the filtrate was accumulated in an immaculate and dried decreased container by standard cleaned filtration system and put away.
