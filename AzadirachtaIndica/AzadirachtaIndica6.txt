Neem (Azadirachta indica): A Review on Medicinal Kalpavriksha

Neem, has thrown the light worldwide in  recent years, due  to its  wide range of medicinal properes. The tree  has been  largely used in Naturopathy, Unani and Homoeopathic medicine and has become a lodestar of current medicine. Further it elaborates a vast array of biologi-cally acve compounds that are chemically diverse and structurally complex. More than 150 compounds have been isolated from dierent parts of neem and these have been divided into two major classes isoprenoids and non-isoprenoids, which are proteins and carbohydrates. Further, it consists of sulphurous compounds, polyphenolic compounds such as avonoids and their glycosides, dihydrochalcone, coumarin, tannins and aliphac compounds. All parts of the neem tree viz., leaves, owers, seeds, fruits, roots and bark have been used tradionally for the treatment of inammaon, infecons, fever, skin diseases, dental disorders, etc. Every part of the neem tree viz., roots, seeds, ow-ers, bark, leaves, fruit pulp and its constuents have been demonstrated to exhibit immune modulatory, an-inammatory, an hypergly-caemic, anulcer, anmalarial, anfungal, anbacterial, anviral, anoxidant, anmutagenic, andiabec and ancarcinogenic properes.
Azadirachta indica  is  popularly known  as Indian  neem  or margosa tree. It’s been extensively  used in ayurveda, unani and  homoeopathic  medicine since  time  immemorial.   In Sanskrit a “good health”  condion is expressed as “Nimba” (Sitasiwi et al., 2018), which on due me derived in to “Neem”, further the tree is considered as “Sarvaroga nivarini” means cure all ailments. In Ayurveda neem is known as “Arishtha” meaning  ‘reliever  of sickness’.  The  tree  is  still regarded as  “village  pharmacy”  or “Divine  tree” due  to presence  of medicinal  properes  in India  (Amritalingam, 2001). If  the developing countries  are considered more  than 80% of  the populaon is believed to be dependent on medicinal plants for curing various diseases or disorders (Rupani and Chavez, 2018).  Further,  the  total  trade in  medicinal plants  in India during  2004-05  has  been 4,530  crore. India ranks  second in the world in  terms of the volume and  value of  medicinal plants export. Neem is one of the indigenous medicinal plants of  India  which possess  medicinal  properes in  each and every part viz., roots, seeds, owers, bark, leaves, fruit pulp etc. (Kirkar and Basu, 1975). Neem is one of the examples of complementary  medicine through phytotherapy  (Jose et al., 2020). Each of the plant part has been used in the Indian Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine and has become a cynosure of modern medicine In Ayurvedic literature neem is well known for its medicinal 
properes viz., Neem bark is cool, bier, astringent and acrid. In addion to this, it is used to cure redness, cough, fever, loss of appete, worm  infestaon etc. It also heals wounds and  viated  condions of  kapha, voming, skin  diseases, excessive  thirst  and diabetes.  Along  the bark,  chemical compounds present in the leaves are reported to be valuable for eye disorders and insect poisons. It treats Vak disorder and acts as an-leproc. It’s fruits are bier, purgave, an-hemorrhoids and anthelminthic’. In the view of its immense ulies, this review summarizes the wide range of medicinal uses, pharmacological acvies, biological acvies of neem tree and its compounds and their chemistry. 2.  Neem Compounds and Biological AcvityMore than 150 compounds have been isolated from dierent parts of neem. The compounds have been divided into  two major classes; isoprenoid (Chaerjee and Pakrashi, 1991) like diterpenoids  and  triterpenoids  containing protomeliacins, limonoids,  azadirone  and its  derivaves, gedunin  and  its derivaves, vilasinin type of compounds and C- secomeliacins such as nimbin, salanin and azadirachn) and non-isoprenoids, which are proteins, carbohydrates, sulphurous compounds, polyphenolics  such  as  flavonoids  and their  glycosides, dihydrochalcone, coumarin and tannins, aliphac compounds, etc. Nimbidin, is responsible for  crude bier principle extracted
from  the  oil of  seed  kernels of  A. indica  which possess several biological acvies, from this crude principle some tetranortriterpenes, including nimbin, nimbinin, nimbidinin, nimbolide  and  nimbidic  acid have  been isolated  (Siddiqui, 1942; Schumacher  et  al.,  2011;  Naik et  al., 2014).  Further, Biswas et  al.  (2002)  have  reviewed the  biological  acvies some of the neem compounds,  pharmacological acons  of the  neem  extracts, clinical  study and  plausible  medicinal applications  of  neem along  with their  safety  evaluation. Further,  neem also  possess compounds  acts as  Anti-inflammatory,  Antiarthritic,  Antipyretic, Hypoglycaemic, Antigastric  ulcer,  Spermicidal, Antifungal,  Antibacterial, Diurec, Anmalarial,  Antumour,  Immunomodulatory  etc (Joshi, et al., 2010; Saleem, et al., 2018).3.  Chemistry of Neem CompoundsNatural  compounds  present in  neem  are triterpenes  or limonoids. New limonoids are sll being discovered in neem. Azadirachn, salannin, meliantriol and nimbin are well known (Naik et al., 2014). The bier constuent, the nimbin contains an acetoxy, a lactone, an ester, a methoxy and an aldehyde group. Nimbidin contains sulphur. 3.1.  BarkThe bark  exudes a clean bright  amber coloured gum which is collected in small  tears or fragments. It contains a  bier alkaloid  named  “margosine”.  Leaves also  bier principles but in small quanty which are much more soluble in water. This substance is a  hydrate of the resin. Seeds  contain 10% to 31% of a yellow bier xed oil with a strong disagreeable acrid taste. The volale fay acids present in the bark consist a mixture of stearic and oleic acids along lile amount of lauric acid. Trunk  bark yields 0.04%  nimbin, 0.001 nimbinin,  0.4% nimbidin,  and  essenal  oil  0.02%. Tetracyclic  triterpenoids and their derivaves have been isolated from the stem bark along with tricyclic diterpenoids).3.2.  FlowersFlowers have been found to contain a avonoid. Nimbicen is idencal to kaempferol. In the dried bark the same bier components as in  the  seed  oil have been found  and in the pericarp of the fruit a bier principle bakayanin was found.3.3.  Neem oilNeem  oil  contains  Sulphur  0.427%;  a  very bier  yellowish substance obtained from the alcoholic extract of the oil, which is supposed to be an alkaloid; resins; glucosides and fay acids3.4.  SeedsMeliacins  found  in  the  seeds  include  gedunin,  7-desacetylgedunin, desace-tylnimbin and azedarachn.The seed oil mainly contains nimbidin, nimbin and nimbinin, which also occur in the stembark (Ara et al., 1989).3.5.  ToddyThe  toddy  or  sap  contains glucose,  sucrose,  gums  and colouring maer.4.  
Medicinal Uses
AyurvedaNeem tree has occupied a prominent place in the tradional Ayurvedic  medicine  in  India from  me immemorial.  Neem bark,  leaf  extracts  and  neem oil  have been under  use  as folk  medicine  to control  various  problems viz.,  leprosy, intesnal  helminthiasis,  conspaon,  etc. Further,  it plays vital role in treang rheumasm, chronic syphilic sores and indolent  ulcers.  Neem  oil is  well known  to control  various skin problems. Bark, leaf, root, ower and fruit together cure blood morbidity, biliary aicons, itching, skin ulcers, burning sensaons and pthysis (Saleem et al., 2018).The  root  bark  and young  fruits are  used  as  an alterave, antiperiodic  and as  a tonic.  Green twigs  are used  as toothbrushes  for  cleaning  teeth and  as a prophylacc  for mouth and  teeth  complaints. The bark,  gum, leaf and seed are used in snake bite and scorpion sng. The bark is used as a bier tonic, astringent, anperiodic, anpyrec and against nausea  and  voming.  Gum is  demulcent tonic  in catarrhal aecons. Leaves are used as poulce for boils. Decocon of leaves used as an ansepc in ulcers and eczema. Dry owers are stomachic. Seed  oil  is a smulant, ansepc,  alterave in  rheumatism  and skin  diseases.  Berries are  purgative, emollient and anthelminthic. An extract of leaves is used in toothpastes. Neem oil is eecve in the treatment of leprosy and skin diseases.4.2.  HomoeopathyUsed against rheumac pains. Pain in sternum and ribs, in the extremies and  aches in hands and  toes. Also used  against eczema, pemphigus and scabies.4.3.  UnaniNeem  nds  use  as a  resolvent and  blood  purier. Leaves expel  wind,  heal ulcers  in  urinary passages.  Used  as an emmenagogue  and  in skin  diseases.  Fruit is  used as  an astringent and in leprosy and bronchis.4.4.  Immunosmulant acvityVarious studies have revealed that the aqueous extract of leaf and bark possesses  ancomplement  and  immunosmulant acvity.  Neem  oil has  been shown  to  possess acvity  by selecvely acvang the cell-mediated immune mechanisms to elicit  an enhanced response to  subsequent mitogenic or angenic challenge (Sen et al.,1992; Biswas et al., 2002).4.5.  Hypoglycaemic acvityNeem leaf  extracts  showed promising results in  decreasing blood sugar level and prevents adrenaline as well as glucose-induced hyperglycaemia. Recently, hypoglycaemic eect was observed with leaf extract and seed oil in normal as well as alloxan-induced diabec rabbits (Ray et al., 1996).4.6.  Anulcer eectNeem leaf and bark aqueous extracts produce highly potent anacid secretory and anulcer acvity. A signicant anulcer eect was observed with nimbidin in prevenng acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, stress or serotonin-induced gastric lesions as well as histamine or cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers
Anferlity eectNeem seed and leaf extract possess the chemical constuents which can act as an-ferlity sources. Studies on this concept have revealed that intra-vaginal applicaon of neem oil, can prevent  pregnancy,  thereby stang  it as  a  novel  method of  contracepon.  NIM- 76,  a rened product  from  neem oil,  was  studied  in  10 human  volunteers,  where  intra-vaginal applicaon  before sexual intercourse could prevent pregnancy with no adverse eect on vagina, cervix and uterus, further,  the  study  revealed that  intrauterine treatment  is safe. Aqueous  extracts  of seeds and leaves  contain sodium nimbinate  (triterpene)  which showed  anferlity acvity (Pillai et al., 1978; Sinha, 1984; Upadhyay et al., 1994).4.8.  Anmalarial acvityNeem  seed  and leaf  extracts  are effective  against  both chloroquin-resistant and sensive strain malarial  parasites. One of the neem’s components, “gedunin”  (a limonoid),  is as eecve as quinine against malaria. Malaria is one of the pandemic diseases  causing  millions of deaths every  year  in India and several other countries. China has adopted neem in a big way to reap the anmalarial eects of neem. The an-malarial formulaon “Quinahausa” prepared in China will be available in India as well. Neem oil treated mosquito nets and mosquito-repellent cheap tablets are also becoming popular, due  of  growing problems  of  resistance to  conventional treatments, it is becoming more and more dicult to control malaria.  Clinical  trials have  been conducted  to  check  the ecacy of neem extracts to control hyperlipidemia in a group of malarial paents severely infected with P. falciparum. The lipid level, especially cholesterol, was found to be lower during therapy when compared to non-malaria paents (Rochanakij et al., 1985; Mukherjee et al., 1999).4.9.  Anfungal acvityFrom me  immemorial it is believed that  Neem is eecve against  certain  fungi that  infect  the  human body.  Some important fungi against which neem preparaons have been found to  be eecve are:  athlete’s foot fungus that  infects hair, skin and  nails;  a ringworm that invades  both  skin and nails of the feet, fungus develops in intesnal tract, bronchi, lungs, and  mucous membranes and a fungus  that is part of the normal mucous ora that can get out of control leading to lesions  in  mouth (thrush), vagina,  etc.   Extracts of  neem leaf,  neem  oil seed  kernels  are effective  against certain fungi  including  Trichophyton,  Epidermophyton, Microspor, Trichosporon, Geotricum and Candida (Kalid et al., 1989)4.10.  Anbacterial acvityNeem  derives  compounds especially  Azadirachn is  well known  for  its role  as anbacterial  agent.  It is  a complex tetranorteiterpenoid limonoid present in the seeds as well as  leaves  which is  highly  responsible for  toxic  effect on microbes. (Quelemes et al., 2015; Gupta, et al., 2019). Extracts of the leaves,  seed and bark possesses  a  wide spectrum of anbacterial acon against Gram-negave and Gram-posive microorganisms, including M. tuberculosis and streptomycin resistant strains. In vitro, it inhibits Vibrio cholerae Klebsiella pneumoniae,  M.  tuberculosis  and M. pyogenes  (Khan and Wassilew, 1987). Anmicrobial eects of neem extract have been  demonstrated  against Streptococcus mutans  and S. faecalis (Chopra et al., 1952). Apart from azadirachn, other components such  as nimbidin, nimbin, nimbolide,  gedunin, mahmoodin, margolone, and cyclic trisulde contribute to the an-bacterial acvity of neem (Al Akeel et al., 2017; Heyman et al., 2017). Further, neem extracts are a ray of hope to cure deadly diseases  viz., Chagas disease in Lan America which was  uncontrolled  by  any  other means  of medicines. This disease is caused by a parasite which is carried by an insect called kissing bug. Research has shown that feeding neem to the bugs  not  only frees them  of  parasites, but azadirachn prevents the young insects from molng and the adults from reproducing. 4.11.  Anviral acvityAqueous leaf extract oers anviral acvity against Vaccinia virus, Chikungunya and measles virus (Rao et al., 1969; Baswa et al., 2001). Nimbin and nimbidin have been found to have anviral  acvity.  They  aect potato  virus X,  vaccinia virus, and fowl pox virus.4.12.  Ancancer acvityNeem  leaf  aqueous  extract  effectively suppresses  oral squamous cell carcinoma induced  by 7,  12-dimethylbenz[a] anthracene  (DMBA),  as revealed  by reduced  incidence of neoplasm  (Gogati  and Marathe,  1989).   Pramanik  et  al. (2016)  has  conducted a  study  in chemoprotective  neem compounds viz., azadirachn, nimbolide and limonoid enrich extracts  on  models of  buccal carcinogenesis in  hamsters. Overall studies were tested posive to reduce the expression and  cell  proliferaon  angens.  Further, researchers  have shown  prominent  an-cancerous  acvies from  limonoid-derived  compounds  from  neem.  Amongst  these,  both 1-O-deacetylohchinolide B  and 15-O-deacetylnimbolindin-B are proved  to be benecial to  hinder cell growth  in human cervical adenocarcinoma (Zhu et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018). A very recent study discovered that alkaloid-derived limonoid, azadiramide-A,  is  primarily found  in Neem  leaf  ethanolic extracts, showed to stop cell growth and induce apoptosis in both the estrogen independent MDAMB-231 and estrogen dependent MCF-7 cell lines of breast cancer in human beings (Elumalai et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2017).4.13.  Anoxidant acvityThe  antioxidant  activity of  neem  seed extract  has  been demonstrated in vivo during horse- grain germinaon which is associated with low levels of lipooxygenase acvity and lipid peroxides (Balasenthil et al., 1999). An anoxidant principle has also been isolated, which is a potent inhibitor  of plant lipooxygenases. An-oxidants derived from  neem is simple and cost  eecve way to  supplement with natural extracts like  those  derived  from Neem,  in forms  such as  teas  and oils, seem to be a simple and cost-eecve way to introduce anoxidants (Alzohairy, 2016).
Anti-diabec eect Diabetes is one of the major chronic degenerave disorders now  the  world is  facing  (Joshi et  al.,  2010; Shori,  2012; Hieronymus and Grin, 2015). According to the health survey conservavely by 2030 there is expectancy for diabetes to be the 11th leading cause of death (Mathers and Loncar, 2006). Keeping in view of the severity of disease searching the ways for lower cost treatments must be need of hour. Among the various methods and pharmaco therapies being developed, the use of Neem extracts has steadily grown in interest (Joshi et al., 2010; Al Akeel et al., 2017).  Several studies carried out in induced-diabec  rat models have revealed  rescue of the G6PD when  treated  with Neem extracts (Basir  and Shailey, 2012; Upre et al., 2013).4.15.  Eect on central nervous systemVarying degrees of central nervous system (CNS) depressant acvity in mice was observed with the leaf extract (Rao et al., 1998). Fracons of acetone extract of leaf showed signicant CNS depressant acvity (Singh et al., 1987). Leaf extract up to a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight produces signicant anxiolyc acvity in rats (Singh et al., 1980). The crude ethanolic extracts of stem bark and root bark showed hypotensive, spasmolyc and diurec acvies (Bhakuni et al., 1971).4.16.  Other acvity The  gum  from  bark is  a smulant  and demulcent tonic.  It possesses an-leprosy,  anspirochaetal, and immenagogue properites.  Neem  is  widely used  for treang  fevers. It  has anti-pyretic  (fever-reducing)  property. Apart  from these benets, neem products also have analgesic (pain-relieving) and an-inammatroy eects, i.e. for most common ailments neem can  provide organic, cheap, easily available  and local medicines, thereby neem can bring sustainable livelihood to many people especially in rural and tribal regions.5.  ConclusionNeem  is one  the best  nontoxic  biological  sources for development  of  modem drugs.  Therefore,  wide variety of  neem  extracts  extend their  benets beyond  tradional medical  folklore,  hence  through the  use of  scienc  and technological  advance  now  we  can use  neem extracts as current medical adjuvants,  on  humans,  animals  and  plants by understanding  their potenal. Considering  the immense importance  of  this “Kalpavriksha”  it can  be  explored for economic  and  therapeutic  utilization  for a  sustainable development. 6.
