Use of neem   (Azadirachta indica) for natural protection against insect pests of cabbage in winter crops

Summary:
Market gardening in Burkina Faso is almost exclusively under irrigation between October and April, the dry and cool period of the year. This leads to market congestion between March and April. However, the period from June to October is one of the difficult, if not impossible, periods for certain vegetable crops without phytosanitary treatment. Phenomenon essentially due to high humidity conditions associated with equally high average temperatures (26 to 30°C). A great deal of research has been done on the use of different methods and products for effective control of different vegetable pests. Among the many products used, Jacobson, 1980, reports that crude extracts of neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) showed a great protective effect (concentration less than or equal to 0.1 ppm); also, Ouédraogo J. (1990), reports that neem has a broad spectrum of protection against many crop enemies. This work was carried out with the aim of verifying the impact of neem cakes on the natural protection of cabbage in winter crops. The choice of cabbage as a test plant for this study is guided by the fact that Burkinabè cabbage producers are continually confronted with large losses (often estimated at more than 60%) if the plots are not treated every three to four days. with chemicals, which are rarely approved for leafy greens.
