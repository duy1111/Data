Distribution
A common roadside weed on lowlands at low and medium altitudes.
Probably introduced.
Probably originated from America.
Found in all warm countries.
Constituents
The powdered leaves yield tannin, some reducing sugar and resin, but no alkaloid.
Studies yielded amino acids lysine, arginine, histidine, cystine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.
Study yielded spinosterol (24 ethyl 22 dehydrolathosterol) as major component along with 24 methyllathosterol 24ethyllathosterol, 24 methyl 22dehydrolathosterol, 24 ethyl cholesterol and 24 ethyl 22 dehydrocholesterol as minor components in sterol fraction.

(26)
Study for nutrient content in A. viridis spinach chips yielded vitamin C 4.8 mg/100 g, Ca 814.9 mg/kg, Fe 27.4 mg/kg, and K 709.8 mg/kg, and retained nutrient value even though it was cooked as chips. (27)
Plant yields various biologically active constituents viz. saponins, tannins and phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, cardiac glycoside, steroid and triterpenoids. (33)
Study for mineral composition (ppm) yielded Mg 8255 ±6.10, Ca 15280 ±5.80, Cr 5.16 ± 0.05, Mn 108.10 ± 0.08, Fe 480 ± 3.20, Co 0.42 ± 0.11, Cu 12.44 ± 0.10. (34)
Study for total phenolic content, Antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging activity yielded 36.0 ± 1.33 GAE mg/g, 1488.20 ± 50.01 FRAP µM FeSO4/g, 16.04 DPPH inhibition %, respectively. (34
