Nutraceuticals, antioxidant pigments, and phytochemicals in the leaves of Amaranthus spinosus and Amaranthus viridis weedy species

Introduction
The family Amaranthaceae consists of 70 Amaranthus species of which 17 produce edible leaves and 3 produce food grains1. Amaranthus species are C4 plants with rapidly grown vegetables, ornamental, and grains plants. It is widely distributed and cultivated in Asia, Africa, America, Australia, and Europe. Leaves and succulent stems of Amaranthus are inexpensive and excellent sources of protein with essential amino acids lysine and methionine, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, dietary fiber, and essential minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, copper, and manganese2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Some genera of this family are widely used as traditional medicinal plants for remedy of viral diseases, malarial, diabetic, bacterial, helminthic infections and as snake antidote9,10,11. Besides these, it is also an excellent and unique source of antioxidant leaf pigments, such as   cyanin,   xanthin, betalain, and a source of other pigments, such as carotenoids, anthocyanin, and chlorophylls12,13, and antioxidant phytochemicals, such as   carotene, vitamin C, phenolics, and flavonoids14. Most of these compounds are natural antioxidants and detoxify ROS in the human body, hence, it had great importance for the food industry15,16.   Cyanin,   xanthin, betalain, carotenoids, and amaranthine pigments have important free radical scavenging activity17. It has wide adaptability to different abiotic stresses like drought18,19,20,21 and salinity22,23,24 and versatile uses.
Weedy amaranth (A. spinosus and A. viridis) originates probably from lowland of South and Central America. At present, it is wide spreads over the tropical and subtropical regions, including tropical Africa, South East Asia, Americas as well as temperate Europe. In tropical Africa and elsewhere weedy amaranth leaves and young plants are collected for sale on markets for home consumption as a cooked, steamed or fried vegetable, especially during periods of drought. It tolerates drought, responds to high levels of available nutrients, and adapted to a harsh environment through rapid stem elongation25,26,27.
Weedy amaranth (A. spinosus and A. viridis) possesses analgesic and antipyretic properties and is used for the treatment of pain and fever as traditional medicine. A. viridis weedy amaranth used as antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, anti nociceptive, anti inflammatory, hypolipidemic, antihyperglycemic, anthelmintic, anti phytopathogenic, and antidiabetic activity28. Both weedy species have numerous medicinal uses like astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic, emollient, febrifuge, galactogogue, gonorrhea, eczema, burns, wounds, boils, earache, haemorroids, bronchitis. sudorific, antidote to snake poison, menorrhagia. internal bleeding, diarrhea, stomach disorders, ulcerated mouths, nosebleeds, wounds and dysentery25,26,27,29.
In Bangladesh, there are a lot of weedy amaranths (A. spinosus and A. viridis) grown in the roadside, fallow land and as a weed in the crop field. It is a very popular leafy vegetable and becoming increasingly popular due to its test, flavor, and color. People harvest it and sell in the market as a leafy vegetable. However, no research has been carried out to evaluate the nutritional components, antioxidant phytochemicals and their antioxidant capacity in the leaves of A. spinosus and A. viridis weedy species. Stinzing et al.30 reported betacyanins and phenolic compounds in A. spinosus stem. But the literature of other cultivated amaranth has shown that leaves contain several times higher nutritional components, antioxidant phytochemicals and their antioxidant capacity than stem15,31. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the possibility of A. spinosus and A. viridis weedy species as a leafy vegetable in terms of nutritional components, antioxidant phytochemicals and their antioxidant capacity for achieving nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency in our daily diet.
Antioxidant leaf pigments
Antioxidant leaf pigments of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes are presented in Table 4. Prominent variations in chlorophyll a content (267.85 to 302.56  g g−1 FW) were noted in A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes. Comparatively, A. viridis genotypes exhibited higher chlorophyll a content than A. spinosus genotypes. A. viridis genotype WAV7 showed the highest chlorophyll a content (302.56  g g−1 FW) followed by A. viridis genotype WAV9. On the other hand, the lowest chlorophyll a content (267.85  g g−1 FW) was noted in A. spinosus genotype WAS13 and WAS156. Similar to chlorophyll a, significant and noticeable differences were recorded in chlorophyll b content (135.26 to 152.42  g g−1 FW) of selected six A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes. A. spinosus genotypes showed higher chlorophyll b content compared to the genotype of A. viridis. The highest chlorophyll b content was observed in A. spinosus genotype WAS13 (152.42  g g−1 FW) followed by WAS11 and WAS15.

A. viridis genotype had the highest chlorophyll a and chlorophyll ab content, while A. spinosus genotype exhibited the highest chlorophyll b content.
  Cyanins content had no prominent variations in selected six A. spinosus and A. viridis genotypes (185.52 to 538.51 ng g−1 FW) albeit it showed significant variations in terms of genotypes. Comparatively, A. viridis genotypes exhibited higher   cyanins content than A. spinosus genotypes, albeit A. spinosus genotype WAS15 had the highest   cyanins content (286.46 ng g−1 FW) along with A. viridis genotypes WAV9 and WAV7 (287.56, 285.33 ng g−1 FW). Higher   cyanins content was noted in A. spinosus genotype WAS11 (282.84 ng g−1 FW). On the other hand, A. viridis genotype WAV4 showed the lowest   cyanins content (276.34 ng g−1 FW). The significant variations were observed in   xanthins content in selected six A. spinosus and A. viridis genotypes with a range of 246.87 to 275.86 ng g−1 FW. A. spinosus genotypes exhibited higher   xanthins content compared to A. viridis genotypes. A. spinosus genotype WAS13 exhibited the highest   xanthins content (275.86 ng g−1 FW) followed by A. spinosus genotype WAS15. Conversely, the lowest   xanthins content was noted in A. viridis genotype WAV7 (246.87 ng g−1 FW). The significant variations were recorded for betalains content of selected six A. spinosus and A. viridis genotypes (532.12 to 561.42 ng g−1 FW). A. spinosus genotypes exhibited higher betalains content compared to A. viridis genotypes. Betalains content was the highest in A. spinosus genotype WAS15 (561.42 ng g−1 FW) followed by A. spinosus genotype WAS13, while the lowest betalains content was reported in A. viridis genotype WAV4 and WAV7 (532.12, 532.24 ng g−1 FW). Like betalains, carotenoids showed significant variability in selected six A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes (68.52 to 92.87 mg 100 g−1 FW). A. viridis genotypes exhibited higher carotenoids content compared to A. spinosus genotypes. The highest carotenoids content was observed in A. viridis genotype WAV7 (92.87 mg 100 g−1 FW) followed by A. viridis genotype WAV9. Whereas, A. spinosus genotype WAS11 and WAS13 exhibited the lowest carotenoids content (68.52, 69.82 mg 100 g−1 FW). Our study showed notable chlorophyll a (302.56  g g−1 FW), chlorophyll ab (445.22  g g−1 FW),   cyanins (287.56 ng g−1 FW), and carotenoids content (92.87 mg 100 g−1 FW) in A. viridis genotype, while chlorophyll b (152.42  g g−1 FW),   cyanins (286.46 ng g−1 FW),   xanthins (274.96 ng g−1 FW), and betalains content (561.42 ng g−1 FW) in A. spinosus genotype. Similarly, Khanam and Oba36 observed similar trend in chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll ab,   cyanins,   xanthins, betalains and carotenoids content of green and red amaranth. A. viridis genotype had the highest chlorophyll a, chlorophyll ab,   cyanins, and carotenoids content while A. spinosus genotype exhibited the highest chlorophyll b,   cyanins,   xanthins, and betalains content.
Antioxidant phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity
  Carotene, Vitamin C, TPC, TFC and TAC of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes are presented in Table 5. Pronounced variations were observed in   carotene content of selected six A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes which ranged from 46.76 in A. viridis genotype WAV7 to 64.22 mg 100 g−1 FW in A. spinosus genotype WAS11. Both species exhibited high   carotene as compared to leafy vegetable. A. viridis genotypes exhibited higher   carotene compared to A. spinosus genotypes. Higher   carotene content was noticed in A. viridis genotype WAV4 and WAV9. A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes showed prominent variations in vitamin C content with a range of 44.62 to 107.45 mg 100 g−1 FW. Both species exhibited high vitamin C as compared to leafy vegetable. Vitamin C was the highest in A. viridis genotype WAV7 and WAV9 (107.45, 106.64 mg 100 g−1 FW) and the lowest in A. spinosus genotype WAS11 (44.62 mg 100 g−1 FW). A. viridis genotypes exhibited higher vitamin C content compared to A. spinosus genotypes. Marked and significant variations were noted in total polyphenol content (TPC) of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes which ranged from 25.98 GAE  g g−1 FW to 46.72 GAE  g g−1 FW. Genotypes of both species exhibited high phenolics as compared to leafy vegetable. A. viridis genotype WAV9 showed the highest TPC content 46.72 GAE  g g−1 FW followed by A. viridis genotype WAV7. While A. spinosus genotype WAS13 exhibited the lowest TPC (24.98 GAE  g g−1 FW). TFC showed no noticeable variations in terms of six selected A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes, though genotypes of both species had high flavonoids content (174.58 RE  g g−1 DW to 182.46 RE  g g−1 DW). A. viridis genotype WAV9 and A. spinosus genotype WAS13 had the highest TFC (182.46, 182.36 RE  g g−1 DW) followed by A. spinosus genotype WAS15, whereas A. viridis genotype WAV4, WAV7, and A. spinosus genotype WAS11 showed the lowest TFC (174.58, 175.64 and 176.46 RE  g g−1 DW) though both weedy species had high flavonoids. A. spinosus genotypes exhibited higher TFC compared to A. viridis genotypes, albeit differences were very low. A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes exhibited high TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) as a leafy vegetable and there were pronounced variations in terms of TAC (DPPH and ABTS+). A. spinosus genotypes exhibited higher TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) compared to A. viridis genotypes. The highest TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) were observed in A. spinosus genotype WAS13 (27.56, 52.35 TEAC  g g−1 DW) followed by A. spinosus genotype WAS11 and WAS15. On the other hand, the lowest TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) was recorded in A. viridis genotype WAV7 (21.96, 48.23 TEAC  g g−1 DW). A similar trend of TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+) in terms of genotypes validated the measurement of two different methods of antioxidant capacities. The highest   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, and TAC (DPPH and ABTS+) were obtained from A. viridis genotypes, while A. viridis genotypes had the highest TFC, and TAC (DPPH and ABTS+). In the present investigation, A. viridis genotypes exhibited outstanding   carotene and vitamin C (64.22 and 107.45 mg 100 g−1 FW) which was higher than red amaranth of our previous studies3. TPC (46.72 GAE  g g−1 FW) obtained in this study was higher than the results of Khanam et al.37 in red and green amaranth. TFC (182.46 RE  g g−1 DW) TAC (DPPH) (27.56 TEAC  g g−1 DW) and TAC (ABTS+) (52.35 TEAC  g g−1 DW) obtained from weedy amaranth in this study, were similar to the results of Khanam et al.37 in red amaranth whereas, our obtained results were higher than the results of Khanam et al.37 in green amaranth. The A. viridis genotype WAV7 and A. spinosus genotype WAS13 had high nutrients, pigments vitamins, phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant. These two weedy Amaranthus accessions could be used as antioxidant profile enriched high yielding varieties with high nutritional and antioxidant activity. The present investigation revealed that weedy Amaranthus is an excellent source of nutritional value, antioxidant phytochemicals, and antioxidant activity offered huge prospects as cultivated vegetable amaranth to feeding the mineral, vitamin, and antioxidant deficient community.
Correlation studies
Correlation of antioxidant leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+) of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes are presented in Table 6. Correlation of antioxidant leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+) of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes showed interesting results. Significant positive associations with TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+) were observed for all antioxidant leaf pigments. It indicated that the increase in TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+) were directly related to the increment of chlorophylls,   cyanins,   xanthins, betalains, and carotenoids content or vice versa. It meant all leaf pigments had strong antioxidant activity. Similarly, vitamin C had a significant positive interrelationship with TPC, TFC, and TAC, while it exhibited insignificant negative associations among all antioxidant leaf pigments. Sarker and Oba18,24 in their earlier work in amaranth also observed a similar trend. A significant positive association was exhibited among   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH), and TAC (ABTS+). The significant positive interrelationship of   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC, TAC (DPPH), and TAC (ABTS+) signify that   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, TFC had strong antioxidant activity. The validation of the antioxidant capacity of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes by two different methods of antioxidant capacity measurements were confirmed with the significant positive associations between TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+). Antioxidant phytochemicals such as leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, and TFC had strong antioxidant activity, as these showed the significant associations with TAC (DPPH) and TAC (ABTS+). In the present investigation, all antioxidant leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, TPC, and TFC played a vital role in the antioxidant activity of A. viridis and A. spinosus genotypes as these compounds had strong antioxidant activity.
In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that leaves of both weedy Amaranthus genotypes exhibited as a good source of potassium, calcium, magnesium, P, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, B, Mo, protein, dietary fiber, carbohydrates as a leafy vegetable. It is an excellent source of antioxidant leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, TAC, TPC and TFC and antioxidant that could contribute to human nutrition and health. The A. viridis genotype WAV7 and A. spinosus genotype WAS13 identified as the best accessions and could be cultivated as like as cultivar as a potential source of nutritional value, antioxidant leaf pigments,   carotene, vitamin C, phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidants in our daily diet to reduce the hidden hunger and accomplishing nutritional and antioxidant sufficiency. Weedy Amaranthus species are the excellent source of phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidants that have many pharmacological effects of their traditional applications. Finally, the obtained data present a valuable contribution to the scientific evaluation of pharmacologically active principles in weedy species.
Methods
Experiment materials, design, layout, and cultural practices
Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University collected several accessions (genotypes) of weedy amaranth (A. spinosus and A. viridis) from different agro ecological zones of Bangladesh. We selected six genotypes (three accessions from each species) based on different morphological traits and different agroecological zones. We grew the selected genotypes at the experimental field of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Bangladesh in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The unit plot size of each genotype was one square meter. The spacing of each A. spinosus and A. viridis genotype was 20 cm distance from row to row and 5 cm distance from the plant to plant. Recommended fertilizer, compost doses, and appropriate cultural practices were maintained. Thinning was done to maintain appropriate spacing between plants of a row. As a necessity, weeding and hoeing were done to remove the weed. To maintain the normal growth of the crop proper irrigations were provided. At 30 days after sowing of seed, leaves samples were collected. All the parameters were measured in three replicates.

Chemicals
Solvent: acetone and methanol. Reagents: H2SO4, HNO3, HClO3, NaOH, dithiothreitol (DTT), caesium chloride, ascorbic acid, standard compounds of pure Trolox (6 hydroxy 2, 5, 7, 8 tetramethyl chroman 2 carboxylic acid), gallic acid, rutin, folin ciocalteu reagent, DPPH (2, 2 diphenyl1 picrylhydrazyl), ABTS+, aluminium chloride hexahydrate, sodium carbonate, potassium acetate, and potassium persulfate. All solvents and reagents used in this study were high purity laboratory products obtained from Kanto Chemical Co. Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) and Merck (Germany).

Proximate composition
AOAC method was followed18 to estimate the ash, moisture, crude fat, fiber, crude protein contents, and gross energy. Micro Kjeldahl method was followed to determine crude protein with nitrogen to a protein conversion factor of 6.25 (AOAC method 976.05). We subtracted the sum of moisture, ash, crude fat, and crude protein percentage from 100 to measure carbohydrate content (g 100 g−1 FW).

Estimation of mineral content
At first, A. spinosus and A. viridis leaves were dried at 70 °C in a well ventilated oven for 24 hours. Dried leaves were grounded finely in a mill. Nitric perchloric acid digestion method18 was followed to determine the macronutrients (Ca, Mg, K, P, and S) and microelements (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Na, Mo, and B) from powdered leaves. For this digestion, 400 ml of nitric acid (65%), 40 ml of perchloric acid (70%) and 10 ml of sulphuric acid (96%) in the presence of carborundum beads were added to 0.5 g dried leaf sample. After digestion, the solution was appropriately diluted in triplicate for measuring P following ascorbic acid method. Yellow colored complex converted to a blue colored phosphomolybdenum complex when ascorbic acid and Sb was added to the solution. Sarker and Oba18 method was followed to read the absorbance by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at wavelength of 76 6.5 nm (K), 422.7 nm (Ca), 285.2 nm (Mg), 880 nm (P), 258.056 nm (S), 248.3 nm (Fe), 279.5 nm (Mn), 324.8 nm (Cu), 213.9 nm (Zn), 589 nm (Na), 313.3 nm (Mo), and 430 nm (B).

Determination of chlorophylls and total carotenoids
The fresh A. spinosus and A. viridis leaves were extracted in 80% acetone to estimate chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll ab and total carotenoids following Sarker and Oba18 method. A spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U 1800, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance at 663, 646 and 470 nm for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total carotenoids, respectively. Data were expressed as  g chlorophyll per g fresh weight (FW) and mg carotenoids per 100 g FW.

Determination of   cyanin and   xanthin content
The fresh A. spinosus and A. viridis leaves were extracted in 80% methanol containing 50 mM ascorbic acid to measure   cyanin and   xanthin following the method of Sarker and Oba18. A spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U 1800, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance at 540 and 475 nm for   cyanin and   xanthin, respectively. The results were expressed as nanogram betanin equivalent to per gram FW for   cyanin and nanograms indicaxanthin equivalent to per gram FW for   xanthin.

Estimation of   carotene
Method of Sarker and Oba18,38 was followed to extract and determine   carotene content. 500 mg of fresh leaf sample was ground in 10 ml of 80% acetone and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3–4 min to carry out the extraction process. The final volume was brought up to 20 ml after removing the supernatant in a volumetric flask. A spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U 1800, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance at 510 nm and 480 nm. Data were expressed as mg   carotene per 100 g fresh weight.

The   carotene content was calculated using the following formula:

Amountof𝛽 carotene=7.6(Abs.at480)−1.49(Abs.at510)×Finalvolume/(1000×freshweightofleaftaken)
Determination of vitamin C
The fresh A. spinosus and A. viridis leaves were used to measure ascorbic acid (AsA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) acid spectrophotometrically. For pre incubation of the sample and reduction of DHA into AsA Dithiothreitol (DTT) was used. AsA reduced Fe3+ to Fe2+ and estimation of AsA was made by the spectrophotometric (Hitachi, U 1800, Tokyo, Japan) measuring Fe2+ complexes with 2, 2 dipyridyl18,39. Finally, the absorbance of the sample solution was read. Data were recorded as mg ascorbic acid per 100 g fresh weight (FW).
Extraction of samples for TPC, TFC and TAC analysis
At the edible stage (30 Days after sowing), A. spinosus and A. viridis leaves were harvested. The leaves were air dried in shade for chemical analysis. 40 ml of 90% aqueous methanol was used to extract 1 g of grounded dried leaves from each cultivar in a tightly capped bottle (100 ml). The extract was then placed in a shaking water bath (Thomastant T N22S, Thomas Kagaku Co. Ltd., Japan) for 1 h. Then the extract was filtered for further analytical assays of total polyphenol content, total flavonoid content, total antioxidant activity.
Determination of total polyphenol content (TPC)
Method of Sarker and Oba18,40 was followed to estimate the total phenolic content of A. spinosus and A. viridis using the folin ciocalteu reagent with gallic acid as a standard phenolic compound. In a test tube, 1 ml of folin ciocalteu reagent (previously diluted 1:4, reagent: distilled water) was added to 50  l of the leaf extract solution and then mixed thoroughly for 3 min. Then, the mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h in the dark by adding 1 ml of Na2CO3 (10%). A Hitachi U1800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance was read at 760 nm. An equation obtained from a standard gallic acid graph was used to estimate the concentration of total phenolic compounds in the leaf extracts. The results are expressed as  g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g−1 FW.
Determination of total flavonoid content (TFC)
The aluminum chloride colorimetric method38,41 was used to estimate the total flavonoid content of A. spinosus and A. viridis extract. In a test tube, 1.5 ml of methanol was added to 0.1 ml of 10% aluminum chloride, 0.1 ml of 1 M potassium acetate, 2.8 ml of distilled water and 500  l of leaf extract for 30 min at room temperature. A Hitachi U1800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used to take the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 415 nm. TFC is expressed as  g rutin equivalent (RE) g−1 dry weight (DW) using rutin as the standard compound.
Total antioxidant capacity (TAC)
Diphenyl picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical degradation method39,42 was used to estimate the antioxidant activity. In a test tube, 1 ml of 250  M DPPH solution was added to 10  l of leaf extract solution (in triplicate) and 4 ml of distilled water and allowed to stand for 30 min in the dark. A Hitachi U1800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance at 517 nm. Method of Sarker and Oba39,43was followed for ABTS+ assay. 7.4 mM ABTS+ solution and 2.6 mM potassium persulfate were used in the stock solutions. The two stock solutions were mixed in equal quantities and allowing them to react for 12 h at room temperature in the dark for preparation of the working solution. 2850  l of ABTS+ solution (1 ml ABTS+ solution mixed with 60 ml methanol) was mixed with 150  l sample of leaf extract and allowed to react for 2 h in the dark. Aa Hitachi U1800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was used to read the absorbance against methanol at 734 nm. The percent of inhibition of DPPH and ABTS+ relative to the control were used to determine antioxidant activity using the following equation:
Antioxidantactivity(%)=(Abs.blank−Abs.sample/Abs.blank)×100
where, Abs. blank is the absorbance of the control reaction [10  l methanol for TAC (DPPH), 150  l methanol for TAC (ABTS+) instead of leaf extract] and Abs. sample is the absorbance of the test compound. Trolox was used as the reference standard, and the results were expressed as  g Trolox equivalent g−1 DW.
Statistical analysis
The results were reported as the average of three measurements (n = 3). The data were also statistically analyzed by ANOVA using Statistix 8 software, and the means were compared by the Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT) at 1% and level of probability.
