Abstract
Background: Ficus religiosa L (Lauraceae) has been shown to have numerous biological activities such as wound healing, antibacterial, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic and antiinflammatory. However, the effects of this plant on Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate Dihydrate (CHPD) urinary crystals remain obscured. The present study investigated the inhibitory action of an aqueous extract of the Ficus religiosa (F. religiosa)leaves on the growth of CHPD crystals.

Methods: CHPD crystals were grown as a urinary type using single diffusion gel technique in silica hydro-gels. An extract (50, 75 and 100%) of the leaves of F. religiosa was added over to CHPD crystals growth for 12 days to evaluate its inhibitory effect. Thermogravimetric (TGA) and powder X-ray diffraction analyses were performed to characterize the cultured CHPD crystals.

Results: A 75 and 100% aqueous extracts of the leaves of F. religiosa was significantly (P<0.05 and 0.01, respectively) reduced CHPD crystals growth and the inhibition rate was almost >50%. Whereas, a moderate inhibition (P<0.05) of CHPD crystal growth was found in 75% of aqueous leaf extracts of F. religiosa. However, 50% of aqueous leaf extracts of F. religiosa exhibit no inhibition on the CHPD crystal growth.

Conclusion: These results indicate that the higher concentration of the leaf extracts of F. religiosa is highly responsible for the inhibition of CHPD crystal growth. This study may suggest that F. religiosa can be used as therapeutic agent for the treatment of urinary calculi or their prevention.
