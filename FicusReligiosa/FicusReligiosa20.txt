Phytochemical Screening of Ficus religiosa Seeds and Evaluation of its Antioxidant Potential

Ficus religiosa is one of the oldest trees portrayed in Atharvaveda, Arthasastra, Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, Buddhist literature, etc. The wide therapeutic usage of F. religiosa since ancient times is mentioned in Indian traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, Unani, etc. Every part of the tree, leaves, bark, fruits, and seeds are used in herbal medicine and ayurvedic formulations. Based on the previous activities reported, the present study is carried out to validate the traditional medicinal use of F.religiosa seeds by identifying and quantifying the phytoconstituents and their antioxidant activities. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous soxhlet extracts of F.religosa seeds were screened for their Phyto-constituents. Results revealed the presence of phenols, tannins, flavones, flavonones, flavonoids, quinones, coumarins, and cardiac glycosides. The quantitative evaluation of these extracts revealed that the highest amount of TPC (total phenolic contents) (6 ± 0.003), TTC (total tannins contents) (14.44 ± 1.78), and TFC (total flavonoid contents) (89.00 ± 0.089) in terms of mg/g was found in ethyl acetate extract. Nonenzymatic antioxidant assays, i.e., total antioxidant, FRAP, and DPPH assays were performed with all the solvent extracts, which demonstrated various qualities in agreement with the accessible standard as BHT and ascorbic acid. Of all the five extracts, ethyl acetate extract showed maximum antioxidant activity in FRAP and DPPH tests. The results of the present investigation demonstrated significant variations in the phytochemical and antioxidant activities among different solvent extracts of F. religiosa seeds.
