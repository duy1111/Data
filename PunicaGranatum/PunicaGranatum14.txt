Food as Medicine - Pomegranate (Punica granatum, Lythraceae)

Overview

Whole pomegranate on the branchThe name pomegranate is derived from the Latin words pomum (“apple”) and granatus (“seeded”), a suitable name for this scarlet red, tough-skinned fruit enclosing edible, juicy arils (seed pulp) which have been part of human diets for thousands of years.1 The pomegranate plant is a deciduous, fruit-bearing shrub or small tree that can grow up to 25 feet tall. Its glossy green leaves are lance-shaped with smooth margins and are oppositely arranged on the stem.1,2 Pomegranate flowers are bright reddish orange and approximately one inch in diameter, with five to eight petals (though cultivated varieties often have more petals). It takes an average of five to eight months for pomegranate fruits to ripen.3 When ripe, the scarlet red fruit is about three to five inches in diameter and nearly round in shape, with thick, reddish skin and a crown-shaped, toothed calyx.1-4 The number of seeds inside a pomegranate can vary from 200 to 1,400 based on fruit size and variety. An average-sized pomegranate contains approximately 600 seeds, each surrounded by an aril.1,5-6

Native to the region of Persia (from Iran to the Himalayan mountains of northern India), pomegranate is an ancient cultigen that has been cultivated and naturalized throughout the Mediterranean region for more than 5,000 years.1,7 The pomegranate plant can adapt to a variety of climate conditions and is distributed widely throughout Eurasia to the Himalayas.7 Wild pomegranate groves still exist outside abandoned ancient settlements in Georgia and Armenia, which have been dated back to 1000 BCE.1 Pomegranates require a long, hot, dry season to produce productive yields of high-quality fruit. Although they can withstand moderate frosts, the plants are prone to root decay and fungal diseases in wetter climates.1,3

Historical and Commercial Uses

The pomegranate fruit has symbolic meaning in many cultures and has a long history in mythology and religious rites. In Greek and Roman mythology, pomegranates are associated with abundance, fertility, and good luck through the story of Persephone, daughter of Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest.1 The Babylonians regarded pomegranate seeds as an “agent of resurrection,” the Persians believed the seeds Madonna of the Pomegranatewould aid with invincibility on the battle fields, and the ancient Chinese viewed the seeds as a symbol of abundance, fertility, longevity, and immortality. In Buddhism, the pomegranate was deemed one of three blessed fruits, along with citrus (Citrus spp., Rutaceae) and peach (Prunus persica, Rosaceae).7

Pomegranates are a symbol of resurrection and life everlasting in Christian art and are often depicted along with the Virgin Mary and Christ child, symbolizing fertility.7,9 It is the fruit of choice on the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah as a symbol of righteousness, supported by a traditional belief that each of pomegranate’s 613 seeds corresponds to one of the 613 mitzvoth or commandments of the Torah.1

Mesopotamian cuneiform records from the mid-3000s BCE mention pomegranate as an important commodity.12 Pomegranate cultivation was introduced throughout the Mediterranean region and then spread to South China and Southeast Asia along the Silk Road.7 Spanish colonists later introduced pomegranate cultivation to the Caribbean and Latin America.1 The ancient city of Granada in Spain takes its name from the pomegranate fruit.

Pomegranate is cultivated today in tropical and subtropical areas and in a wide variety of warm, dry microclimates.3 There are commercial pomegranate orchards in the Mediterranean basin and throughout the Asian continent and Indian subcontinent. In the American continents, pomegranates are grown commercially in the United States and Chile.3 California produces more than 90% of pomegranates in the United States.10 Worldwide, India, Iran, China, the United States, and Turkey are the main pomegranate producers with total average annual production of 1.5 million tons.7

Pomegranate seeds and juice have myriad culinary uses throughout the traditional cuisines of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Typically, pomegranate arils are consumed fresh or used for preparing juice, canned beverages, jelly, jam, and as a natural flavor and colorant.1,8 The arils, juice, and juice concentrate are used in many sweet and savory dishes, including salads, sauces, dips, glazes, and marinades. In Turkey, pomegranate arils are fermented to make wine, and in Greece, pomegranate is made into a popular confection known as spoon sweets.1 Dried and powdered pomegranate seeds are used as a traditional culinary spice known as anardana (which literally means “pomegranate [anar] seeds [dana]” in Farsi. Anardana is also used to replace pomegranate syrup in Persian and Middle Eastern cuisines.1,4

Pomegranate botanical illustrationPliny the Elder (ca. 23-79), the ancient Greek naturalist and author, noted the importance of pomegranate as a universal therapeutic agent or panacea. Other prominent medical healers of the ancient world and Middle Ages, including Hippocrates (ca. 460-ca. 370 BCE) in Greece, Galen (129-ca. 200 CE) in Rome, and the Persian Avicenna (ca. 980-1037) also wrote about the medicinal use of pomegranate.7 In traditional medicine systems of Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa, pomegranate is included in official pharmacopeias as a therapeutic agent for treating numerous health conditions.7

Pomegranate was commonly used in traditional medicine to lower fevers and treat diarrhea, hemorrhage, dysentery, and parasitic and microbial infections.8 Pomegranate juice is used most frequently for its astringent, cooling properties and often is used as an anti-diarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and general tonic for lax tissues.2,5 The use of pomegranate rind and root bark to treat tapeworm infestations is an ancient indication that is still recorded in various modern medical texts.9 In Ayurvedic medicine, the pomegranate is considered to be “a whole pharmacy unto itself” and is specifically indicated to treat parasites, ulcers, and diarrhea.11 In the Unani traditional medicine system of India, which is based primarily on principles of ancient Greek medicine, pomegranate was an important treatment for diabetes. (See Table 1) Pomegranate’s fruit, rind, flowers, leaves, bark, and roots have been used traditionally as important medicines for a range of human diseases and ailments, although predominantly gastrointestinal in nature.3,4,9

Nutrients and Phytochemicals

Pomegranate fruit is a relatively good source of several vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin K, folate, pyridoxine, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, calcium, iron, and magnesium.13-15 One medium pomegranate delivers 100 calories and yields approximately five ounces of edible fruit.15 The pomegranate arils are composed of 85% water, 10% sugars (e.g., glucose, sucrose, fructose), organic acids (e.g., ascorbic, citric, malic), amino acids (e.g., proline, valine, methionine), and phenolic compounds.5,6 The pomegranate seed itself primarily consists of 70-76% conjugated linolenic acid (i.e., punicic acid), with minor amounts of alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin E, steroids, and cerebroside, an important component of myelin sheaths (fatty tissue enveloping nerve cells).11 Eating the entire seed offers the added benefit of fiber.1,15

Pomegranate fruits contain many different phytochemicals, the majority of which are polyphenols (e.g., tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids).5,14 (See Table 2) An eight-ounce serving of pomegranate juice or one gram of pomegranate extract delivers 368 mg punicalagins, 93 mg anthocyanins, 29 mg ellagic acid, and 98 mg other tannins.16 The intense red color indicates the presence of abundant anthocyanins (mainly cyanidin, delphinidin, and pelargonidin glucosides).5 Anthocyanins are the largest and most important group of flavonoids present in Pomegranate flowerspomegranate arils and juice.8 Pomegranate juice is considered a functional food and can deliver significant amounts of nutrients and bioactive compounds in each serving. Ellagitannin-derived compounds from pomegranate have been studied in cancer research for their anticancer potential.11

All parts of the pomegranate contain polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds that reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and the health benefits of pomegranate have been attributed to the amount and variety of polyphenols.1 The most abundant polyphenols in pomegranate fruits are hydrolysable tannins, specifically punicalagins, which have been extensively evaluated over the past 30 years for their potent antioxidant capacity and, to a large extent, are the source of pomegranate’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-ulcerative properties.3,6 All of these compounds help to decrease oxidative damage to the body and protect cells from free radical damage.8,14

Other important bioactive compounds in pomegranate include punicalins (other hydrolysable tannins); proanthocyanidins; flavonoids (e.g., catechin, quercetin, and luteolin); and phenolic acids (ellagic and gallic acid).5,6 Studies indicate that punicalins and punicalagins increase the production of energy-metabolizing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through microbial fermentation of undigested food in the large intestine. SCFAs are essential for gastrointestinal health and can inhibit potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium species.6

Pomegranate’s abundant polyphenols give the fruit its astringent flavor. The pericarp (both the peel and the membrane) of pomegranate, which comprises 50% of fruit weight, has the largest concentration of polyphenols and contains flavonoids, ellagitannins, and proanthocyanidins.11 The pericarp is also mineral-rich, and contains potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sodium.
Modern Research and Potential Health Benefits

Pomegranate fruit, fruit juice, and rind have been extensively studied for their functional properties, which include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities.8 Because pomegranate contains several groups of potent bioactive compounds, it is categorized as a functional food, which, apart from its basic nutrition, offers additional physiological health benefits and plays a role in preventing or slowing down chronic diseases. Pharmacological research has demonstrated pomegranate’s potent antioxidant properties against damaging hydroxyl and superoxide molecules, while clinical studies have demonstrated that pomegranate’s potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may help reduce risk of heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and some cancers (skin, breast, prostate, and colon).2-3,6,11

Cardiovascular Effects

Pomegranate seedsAccording to epidemiological studies, having high cholesterol is one of the major risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Pomegranate juice has been evaluated for its effects on the cardiovascular system and has been found effective in reducing heart disease risk factors, including increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, macrophage oxidative status, and foam cell formation, all of which are steps in the progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.1,5,8 The ability of pomegranate, especially pomegranate juice, to inhibit LDL oxidation, scavenge free radicals, and inhibit pancreatic lipase is linked to its significant polyphenol content.17

Worldwide, high blood pressure, or hypertension, is a major contributing factor to cardiovascular disease. Studies on the effects of pomegranate juice consumption on blood pressure reveal that consuming just over 1.5 ounces daily on a consistent basis can have beneficial effects on reducing systolic blood pressure.5 A small clinical trial that evaluated the effects of daily consumption of 50 mL of pomegranate juice reported that after one year, systolic blood pressure was reduced by 21% and was directly associated with pomegranate’s potent polyphenols.5 While clinical results did not support a significant improvement in blood lipid profiles, there was a statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Researchers also reported a 36% decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity levels, lowering risk of heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, after one year of pomegranate juice consumption there was a 131% increase in antioxidant levels present in the blood.8 These effects were most significant in hypertensive patients. As a result, the researchers concluded that pomegranate juice could be an effective adjunct to anti-hypertensive medications and an important part of daily diets for those at high risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease.18

Anticancer Effects

The high antioxidant content of pomegranates has been investigated for its potential to decrease the risk of certain cancers (prostate, breast, colon, and lung).14 The ellagitannins in pomegranate prevent cancer cells from accessing nutrients, which leads to a decrease in tumor size and tumor vessel density. Clinical studies on prostate cancer suggest that pomegranate juice consumption may reduce its occurrence.11 The anthocyanins in pomegranate juice not only have strong anti-inflammatory capacity but also can significantly suppress the proliferation of cancer cells by suppressing pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and NF-κB.8 Clinical research supports a synergy of additive, beneficial interactions among extracts of pomegranate juice, pomegranate peel, and pomegranate seeds in their ability to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and decrease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer patients.8,11 Studies have shown that pomegranate seed oil, pericarp, and the fermented juice can inhibit aromatase, which converts androgens to estrogens and plays a key role in beginning stages of breast cancer. Additionally, the lignans present in pomegranate pericarp have been classified as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which can exert agonist or antagonist effects, depending on the type of tissue, when they bind to estrogen receptors.11 The punicic acid in pomegranate seeds and seed oil is a conjugated linolenic acid that has been investigated for its ability to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation of both estrogen sensitive and insensitive breast cancer cell lines.

Metabolic Effects

The World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 1 billion overweight adults globally, 300 million of whom are obese.8 Diabetes continues to be the most common metabolic disease worldwide and is expected to afflict an estimated 333 million people by 2025. Pomegranate flowers, seeds, and juice inhibit α-glucosidase, which slows the absorption of carbohydrates and lowers postprandial blood sugar levels. Moreover, research indicates that polyphenols may suppress fat cell differentiation, increase satiety/fullness and thermogenesis, inhibit pancreatic lipase, increase fat excretion, and reduce inflammation.17 The punicalagins and ellagic acid content in pomegranate fruit may exert an anti-obesity effect by enhancing glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and pancreatic beta cell protection while regulating cholesterol levels.5

Other Uses

In addition to their cardioprotective, anticancer, and metabolic benefits, pomegranate’s bioactive compounds have been evaluated for their uses in improving bone health, chronic inflammation, oral health, photoaging, memory, and brain disorders.3,16

Studies indicate that pomegranate juice may help prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis.1 In addition to its vitamin K content, which is important for bone building, pomegranate’s punicalagins inhibit the number and activity of bone-degrading osteoclasts.5 Clinical studies have found that pomegranate juice consumption is associated with reduced stiffness scores, physical function scores, and serum MMP-13 levels. It also has been shown to improve patient mobility and reduce joint stiffness and severity and frequency of osteoarthritis flare-ups — effects that researchers attribute to pomegranate’s bone-building nutrients and anti-inflammatory phytochemicals.5,19

Among the oldest known traditional health benefits of pomegranate is its potential activity against infectious diseases, fungi, bacteria, and Pomegranate seedsviruses.3 Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that pomegranate has antibacterial effects against several pathogenic and sometimes antibiotic-resistant organisms. Pomegranate’s polyphenols exhibit antibacterial effects on common strains of bacteria that contribute to gingivitis, as well as candidiasis (oral thrush). Pomegranate juice and extract preparations have been shown to be effective as a mouth rinse.8 In one study, a hydroethanolic pomegranate extract decreased dental plaque bacteria by 84%. Additionally, when pomegranate extract was used in combination with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and oxacillin) to treat 30 different strains of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, there was a synergistic effect between pomegranate extract and the antibiotics.

The polyphenols in pomegranate extract also may protect the skin against UVA- and UVB-induced damage, reducing effects of photoaging. Pomegranate peel/rind extract appears to have a regenerative effect on the dermis of the skin by supporting collagen synthesis, and pomegranate seed oil has a regenerative effect on the epidermis by stimulating keratinocyte production.8

Forgetfulness and loss of memory, possibly interfering with daily functioning and quality of life, are among the top health concerns of middle-aged and older adults beginning as early as age 45.16 Short-term and long-term pomegranate juice supplementation (eight ounces daily for six to 12 months) has been shown to improve memory in middle-aged and older participants.5,16 Pomegranate’s ellagitannins help maintain brain health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation as well as amyloid plaque formation, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.16

Consumer Considerations

Pomegranate juice can be safely consumed as a beverage.10 However, like most commercially produced fruit juice beverages, commercial pomegranate juice contains no fiber and must be pasteurized for safety, which significantly reduces the vitamin C content.14 A typical eight-ounce serving of pomegranate juice contains approximately 32 g of sugar (fructose), which is not ideal, especially for individuals with weight management and blood glucose concerns.14,15 However, despite the sugar content, consuming fresh pomegranates will result in better absorption of its most protective phytochemicals than isolated pomegranate extracts.

Pomegranate fruit is seasonally available in markets from October through January in the United States and is available as bottled juice year-round.15 Because 50% of a pomegranate’s weight is from its juicy arils, consumers should choose fruits that feel heavy for their size and have a thin, smooth, taut skin. Pomegranates should be stored in a cool, dark place or in a refrigerator for up to two months.
