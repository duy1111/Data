Medicinal uses, pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, and the molecular mechanisms of Punica granatum L. (pomegranate) plant extracts: A review

1. Introduction
Punica granatum L. is a perishable super fruit grown worldwide. P. granatum plant is characterized as a shrub small tree that is native to the Mediterranean regions [1]. In South Africa, the fruit tree is planted as a hedge which attracts many blue birds during the winter and autumn seasons [2]. P. granatum is an exotic plant in South African soil, given its adaptive behavior, the plant can grow in every region where it is planted. P. granatum is commonly referred to as pomegranate and is a plant of the genus Punica belonging to the family Lythraceae (previously named Punicaceae) [3]. In South Africa, P. granatum is commonly known as “granaat” or “granaatappel” or “bloomgranaat” in Afrikaans language and known as “kgarenate” in Sesotho and commonly referred to as pomegranate in English [4].

Pomegranate is planted across the country and remains one of the loved fruit, which is domestically and commercially available [2]. The South African pomegranate industry (SAPI) emphasizes that P. granatum is one of the oldest fruit plants which can be used and has been used as a medicinal plant [2]. The pomegranate plant and its fruit juice possess health benefits, nutritional benefits, therapeutic benefits, and several bioactive compounds [5]. Given the spectrum in which the plant has been documented, the plant is valuable for use of its peels, seeds, seed oils, roots, trunk (barks), wood spout, leaves, flowers, and fruits rinds [2]. Due to the adaptive nature of the pomegranate, the plant is harvested in various regions and named differently. In Asian countries such as China, Georgia, and Afghanistan diverse number of pomegranates have been reported. [3].

The famous “wonderful” can be found and cultivated in the United States [6], and with emerging cultivators in the Southern hemisphere including South Africa [2], Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Australia [7]. The pomegranate originated from the ancient Mediterranean areas which have cool winters and warm dry summers climate allowing the plant to grow to its best quality [8].

The pomegranate plant is identified by its growth length, which grows up to 4–5 m long and consists of thorny branches around itself [8]. Moreover, the plant has flaky bark which contains shinny crumpled petal leaves [9]. Given the characteristics of the plant, the plant is well cultivated and in demand across the globe [10].

In South Africa, pomegranates are distributed commercially and for home use. Pienaar [2] wrote down that the plant is commercially distributed during the March – July period to the world when the southern hemisphere climate is conducive for pomegranate growing. Moreover, for home use purposes, the plant has been identified as one of the plants to be used for landscaping due to its architectural form and ability to attract bird species by their colorful pinkish flowers and pollen. Pomegranates contain a high amount of bioactive compounds such as phenolics, tannins, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and organic acids and terpenoids [11], [12] The edible part of the fruit (seeds, peels, and juice) are used for beverages and jams [2]. According to the study by Mphahlele et al. [13] and Read et al. [14], pomegranate peels waste can be used as feeds for ruminants.

The seeds are used to treat a variety of ailments including cancer, heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity [13], and to improve male fertility [15]. Other pomegranate use includes cosmetic products production such as anti-dandruff products [16]. Moreover, the pomegranate plant has been reported to have anti-cancerous [17], anti-inflammatory [18], [15], anti-ulcer, anti-depressant, diuretic, cardio-protective, antidiarrheal [19], antioxidants, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic properties [20]. This current review article gathers and presents an update on the ethnomedicinal uses, pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, and molecular mechanisms of Punica granatum L. This knowledge is of paramount importance in the future in drug discovery for the development of novel natural drugs for the treatment of various ailments.

2. Characteristics of Punica granatum
2.1. Punica granatum bark
The P. granatum bark is characterized by its tough wooden brown color which appears twisted and grows up to 5 m tall. P. granatum bark portion has been used traditionally for the treatment of diarrhea [21], inflammation, nose bleeding, sore throat, ulcer, and hoarseness. Also, the bark part is used to combat parasitic ailments, such as malaria [3]. Other related uses of P. granatum, the bark extracts inhibit iron corrosion due to their high thermal properties and acidity [22]. Furthermore, the bark is rich in tannins, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, and terpenoids [24], [25], [23]. The presence of these phytochemicals makes the bark portion to be a natural green corrosion inhibitor [22].

2.2. Punica granatum flowers
The pomegranate flowers bloom during summertime and attract different birds to their trees [2]. The pomegranate flowers are characterized by their stacked oval petals which have a light pink color [9]. Traditional uses of pomegranate flowers include treating cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and to manage obesity [24]. With antimicrobial properties identified, the pomegranate flowers were found to be effective in treating common bacteria such as Salmonella entteriditis and Kentucky which cause intestine infections [26]. Also, flowers are rich in bioactive components such as tannins, terpenes, terpenoids, flavonoids, and organic oils [26], [24], [136]. The common tannins found in flowers are ellagic acids, punicatannin C, and garlic acid [25].

2.3. Punica granatum leaves
The P. granatum leaves are green glossy ovate and can grow up to 3 cm. According to [9], the plant leaves are perennial. Over the years, different traditional uses of pomegranate leaves have been recorded and studied. To name a few, the leaves are used for the treatment and management of cholesterol and body weight loss [24], and diabetic nephropathy [27]. The plant leaves exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-cholinesterase, and cytotoxic properties [28]. Also, anti-bacterial and antibiotic properties were reported in the study [29]. Furthermore, anti-diabetic properties were also determined by [27], [30] and anti-cancerous properties were found in [25]. In a different study, anti-dandruff and anti-lice properties were discovered, and concluded that the leave extract can be used to aid hair growth [16]. Due to the variety of their effects and properties, the pomegranate has been reported to be rich in alkaloids, flavonoids, and tannins, as well as glucose varieties [29], [24], [136].

2.4. Punica granatum seeds
Amongst the P. granatum plant parts, the seeds are the most researched and documented part. Pomegranate seeds are enclosed within the fruit, covered by the red appearing arils, and can be found in hundreds [9]. Some of the common uses of pomegranate seeds include the prevention of miscarriage [31] and the treatment of urinary disorders [25]. Other pharmaceutical properties found to be present in pomegranate seeds include antimicrobial properties [32], [26], anti-cancerous, and antioxidants properties [33]. The pomegranate seeds are rich in a variety of phytochemical compounds including anthocyanins, tannins, fatty acids, flavonoids, ligands compounds, and sterols such as some organic volatile oils [35], [136], [34], [12], [31].

2.5. Punica granatum peels
Pomegranate fruit peels are identified by their hard shield of pericarp which maintains an orange and greenish color when ripe. The peel covers the arils which are divided by a light membrane inside the peel. The pomegranate peels make up 43% of the whole fruit [12]. The peel extracts are traditionally used to treat ulcers, and diarrhea [31], inhibit ribonucleic acid (RNA) replication [23], and are used as ruminant feeds [36]. Different pharmaceutical properties identified in the pomegranate peels include anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory properties, and anti-cancerous effects [25], [33], [37]. The fruit peels were investigated to contain antioxidants activities against breast cancer [31]. Also, over 48 chemical compounds such as alkaloids, anthocyanins, anthocyanidins, tannins, flavonoids, phenolics, proanthocyanidins, sterols, terpenes, and xanthonoids have been found in pomegranate peels [24], [25], [38], [39], [136], [9].

2.6. Punica granatum juice extracts
Pomegranate juice is one of the highly recommended beverages with vitamin C, the juice is extracted from the fruit's sweet red arils pulps and peels. The pomegranate juice is considered a source of phenolic contents [3]. Polyphenolic compounds such as punicalagin and punicalin were isolated from pomegranate juice extracts [40], [9]. Furthermore, the juice has been identified as a source of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, manganese, zinc, and copper [23].

3. Phytochemicals and chemical structures of P. granatum
The P. granatum contains several phytochemicals. For instance, the bark portion of the plant from Fez was extracted with methanol and revealed the presence of phenolics such as polyphenols, flavonoids, sterols, polyterpenes, with phenolics and flavonoids being the most present chemical compounds with (272.82 ± 32.05 µg/mL) and (387.25 ± 1.75 µg/mL), respectively. Although the bark portion was found to lack saponins and alkaloids phytochemicals [22]. Furthermore, the peel extracted in methanol was found to contain the novel pyrrolizine alkaloids (Punicagranine-1) [18]. Additionally, Adiga et al. [19], reported that the whole pomegranate plant is rich in flavonoids, which can be used to facilitate anti-cancerous cardioprotective activities and enhance memory through cognition rehabilitation. In comparison, the peel still contains the highest chemical compounds of the fruit. Adiga et al. [19], further investigated the effects of the aqueous peel extract on enhancing cognition which include learning and memory in vitro study, to treat dementia-related disorders. The study concluded that the aqueous peel extract had a significant impact on the test group which improved cognition (exploration, learning, and retention), compared to the control group which resulted in less significant effects.

Mayasankaravalli et al. [20], isolated several bioactive compounds of the pomegranate peels using aqueous, ethanol, acetone, chloroform, and petroleum ether. Ethanol and aqueous peel extracts contained more active compounds compared to other extracts. Carbohydrates, tannins, saponin, flavonoids alkaloids, quinones, cardiac glycosides, terpenoids, phenols, coumarins, and steroids were present in the aqueous peel extract. Ethanol peel extract had higher quantities of compounds.

The plant contains 17 types of amino acids, minerals, and vitamins C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, retinol, riboflavin, and ferulic acid, with pomegranate bark and roots extracts showing anthelminthic and vermifuge and antiparasitic properties [3]. The pomegranate ethanol peel extract revealed 8 types of proteins extracted from choline chloride urea, ethylene glycol, acetic acid, glucose, sorbitol, citric acid, and sodium acetate urea [36]. Furthermore, punicalin (197.13 ± 86.93 mg/g), punicalagin (54.23 ± 42.23 mg/g), and ellagic acid (25.42 mg/g) were found to be dominant in a peel extract [41].

In addition, other bioactive compounds have been identified in pomegranate including alkaloids, anthocyanins, tannins, flavonoids, phenolics, proanthocyanidins, sterols, terpenes, xanthonoids, fatty acids, organic acids, lignans, saccharides, and vitamin C. The following chemical structures highlight these phytochemical groups:

3.1. Alkaloids
Alkaloids such as pelletierine was extracted from P. granatum. Moga et al. [31], reported that the presence of pelletierine is still controversial. However, in Wong et al. [25], it was discovered that pelletierine has anti-cancerous properties. The pelletierine derivative compounds found in pomegranate include pseudopelletierine, N-methylpelletierine, isopelletierine, 1-pelletierine, and di-pelletierine [25], [38], [42]. Also, pomegranate alkaloids compounds found include caffeine and pyridium chloride (Fig. 1) [35].

3.4. Flavonoids
Pomegranates have antimicrobial, antioxidants, anti-atherosclerosis [3], anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancerous pharmacological activities which are due to the richness of flavonoids bioactive compounds in pomegranates [48]. Flavonoids were identified in the whole fruit, including peels [49], seeds, leaves, juice [35], flowers, pericarps, and barks [25]. Fig. 4 illustrates commonly identified P. granatum flavonoids. Wang, Özen, et al. [35], also identified several common flavonoids including prunin, catechin, chrysin, cyanidin, apigenin, biochanin, glucoside, luteolin, and taxifolin.

3.7. Sterols
Sterols are natural steroids [55], and are the least present bioactive compounds in pomegranate [22], [31]. Sterols' main function is to reduce cholesterol absorption and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the plasma [55]. The primary sterol compound indicated in Puneeth and Sharath Chandra [1] is asiatic acid. While Wong et al. [25], identified stigmasterol, sitosterol, and cholesterol, Fig. 7. Sex steroids (estrone, testosterone, and estriol) are present in P. granatum seeds. Similar sterols compounds including daucosterol, sitosteryl-acetate, and campesterol are recognized to be present in pomegranate, Fig. 7 [25].

3.8. Terpenes and terpenoids
Terpenes and terpenoids are the main bioactive compounds of essential oils and concentrated oils [56]. Terpenes and terpenoids possess various pharmacological benefits such as anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiallergic [56]. Terpenoids (Fig. 8) are classified as secondary metabolites produced by medicinal plants to play an essential role in disease resistance [56]. Terpenes constitute various constituents including monoterpenes which are volatile elements [57], and are found in a small quantity in the pomegranate [22]. Terpenes volatile compounds are represented by alpha (α)-terpenes, alpha-terpineol, and 3-carene, Fig. 9 [35]. Also, alcohol, aldehydes, and oxygenated monoterpenes are identified [58].

3.11. Lignans
Lignans are secondary metabolites which protect plants from pathogens [63]. They have been mentioned to possess health benefits such as defending against cardiovascular diseases, anti-oxidants, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory activity [63]. From the plant juice, Fernandes et al. [64] highlighted 4 major lignans, namely pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol, syringaresinol, and cyclolariciserol, Fig. 12. While Wang et al. [35], indicates that there are several lignans present in P. granatum seeds and whole fruit including matairesinol, and medioresinol (Fig. 12). Moreover, conidendrin, isohydroxymatairesinol, isolariciresinol, phylligenin, secoisolariciresinol, pomegralignan, punicatannin C are some of the lignans identified in P. granatum (Fig. 12) [38], [65].

Owing to the numerous cultivars of pomegranate, the bioactive components presence/absence in specific tissues of a particular cultivar may differ in contents, types, and proportions of constituents due to variation in climatic conditions where the cultivar is grown. Bioactive molecules are derived from the interaction between plants and their environment [71], [67], [68], [69], [70].

4. Pharmacological activities and molecular mechanisms of P. granatum
The plant contains different bioactive compounds which are useful in fighting and treating common ailments. Several studies have documented the extensive availability of the P. granatum chemical compounds. Such studies include reviews and comparative studies and in vitro and vivo studies such as the ones conducted by [72][73], [74], [15], [75], [24]. The different bioactive compounds found in P. granatum. include amino acids, minerals, vitamin C, calcium, iron, phosphorus, retinol, riboflavin, and ferulic acid, with pomegranate bark and roots extracts containing anthelminthic and vermifugic and antiparasitic properties [3].

Pomegranate phenolic contents are the main chemical components that possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties [33]. To investigate the total phenolic contents and phytochemicals, a pomegranate aqueous peel was extracted using a β-cyclodextrin assisted extraction method, which indicated that the phenolic compounds: chlorogenic acid (307.26 mg/L) is the dominant compound and cinnamic acid (2.7 mg/L) is a less dominant compound, these compounds were extracted in peel extract [76]. Moreover, a diagnostic reagent test was conducted to determine the oxidative stress enzyme activities on Nile tilapia, and the findings illustrated that the experimental group feed with 5% of the pomegranate peel diet displayed higher levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase including reduced glutathione [77]. Additionally, the P. granatum seed oil in a DPPH assay indicated (23.6 ± 1.5–62.5 ± 1.3%) and in hydrogen peroxide assay indicated (21.6 ± 1.3–62.8 ± 1.8%) scavenging activity [33]. Table 1 summarized the different pharmacological activities of pomegranate and its bioactive compounds from different studies.

4.1. Antifungal and antibacterial activities
P. granatum is associated with various pharmacological activities including antifungal and antibacterial properties. Punicalagin was isolated from pomegranate; it has been found to inhibit the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains such as Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus sakei ssp. Sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus sulfureus, and Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus columbae [87].

Moreover, P. granatum alcohol and aqueous leave extracts were identified to have anti-fungal properties against the common fungus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium chrysogenum. The alcohol leaves extract exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against C. albicans (14.35 ± 1.549 mg/g), A. niger (13.45 ± 1.6547 mg/g), and P. chrysogenum (14.25 ± 1.8564 mg/g) and aqueous leave extracts against C, albicans (12.55 ± 1.25 mg/g), A. niger (10.25 ± 2.021 mg/g) and P. chrysogenum (11.55 ± 1.564 mg/g) respectively, indicated to be potent against the 3 common fungus [16]. Another review study by Saeed et al. [78], indicated a methanol peel extract to have antimicrobial properties against Staphylococcus and other gram-negative bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Moreover, an ethanol seed extract of the pomegranate plant was found to have antibacterial properties against Streptococcus sangius (140.8 mg/g) at the concentration of 2000 ppm, which inhibited bacterial growth and promoted bacterial death [32]. To further investigate the microbial activities of the P. granatum plant, a study by Gosset-Erard et al. [87], which used an agar diffusion assay found that an ethanol powdered peel extract contains more antimicrobial properties than aqueous, hydroethanolic, acetone, and heptane peel extracts against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (MIC, 0.60 µg.mL−1) and Staphylococcus epidermis (MIC, 0.60 µg.mL−1). Using a broth micro-dilution method, an aqueous peel extract was found to demonstrate effective antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria with the MIC of (64.53 µg/mL) and (22.09 µg/mL) respectively, the observation indicated that when the extracts concentration increase, bacterial growth was inhibited and decreased [79]. Furthermore, pomegranate peel extract has been shown to exert anti-fungal activities against Candida sp. in both in vitro and in vivo study [88], [89]. Also, phenolic compound such as punicalagin was isolated from ethanol, acetone, hydroethanolic, heptane, and aqueous peel extracts using high-performance-liquid chromatography (HPLC), Ultra-HPLC (UHPLC), and solid-phase extraction (SPE). It is responsible for the antimicrobial activities in peel extracts [87].

4.2. Anti-inflammatory activities
Mehta et al. [90], described inflammation as one of the critical processes needed to protect an organism's body against harm. Several inflammatory activities exerted on the body including gastritis, pain, hemorrhage, and headache can be treated using various medicinal plants [91]. Punica granatum with a vast number of biochemical properties is associated with containing anti-inflammatory activity. Beyond using the P. granatum plant for traditional uses and pharmaceutical purposes, the plant has been widely used for cosmetic applications. A paper, by Ko et al. [12], highlighted the extensive use of the pomegranate plant and its fruits for skin care products, anti-inflammatory properties aiding ultraviolet (UV)-induced products, wrinkling products, pigmentation, and color agents to make bathing products. Another study conducted by Bhinge et al. [16], using aqueous and alcohol pomegranate leave extracts investigated the effects of the extracts to promote hair growth in albino mice, by treating mice with alopecia disorders. The aqueous and alcohol leave extracts showed an improved hair growth by 3% compared to the control group. The study also concluded that the alcohol leave extracts are effective and rich in anti-dandruff and anti-lice properties. Methanol, aqueous and ethanol dried Punica granatum peels extracts contains a punicagranine 1, which is associated with anti-inflammatory properties The punicagranine 1 demonstrated inhibitory effects with the IC50 (22.8 ± 1.2 µm) in a Griess assay [18].

The anti-inflammatory molecular signaling pathways were investigated in several studies, for instance, a study conducted by Xu et al. [92], investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of ethanol PFE LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. The PFE reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α). It attenuated the expression of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Also, treatment with PFE suppressed NF-kB activation through the inhibition of IkBα phosphorylation by IKKβ. Moreover, PFE inhibited phosphorylation of MAPK (ERK, JNK, and p38) [92].

Another finding, oral administration of PFE (100 mg/kg) alleviated paw edema by reducing the production of prostaglandin E2 in carrageenan-induced mice paw edema. Based on in vitro results, pomegranate isolated compounds, viz., punicalagin, granatin B, punicalin, and strictinin suppressed COX-2 and iNOS expression, as well as production of NO in LPS-elicited RAW 264.7 macrophages cells [93].

Moreover, another research by Shiner et al. [94], assessed the activity of PGJ and polyphenols (gallic acid and punicalagin) on the paraoxonase 2 (PON2) expression in a macrophage cell line (J774A) treated with PPARγ inhibitor (GW9662) and JNK inhibitor (SP600125). The treatment with PGJ (50 μM), gallic acid (50 μM), and punicalagin (30 μM) caused a reduction in free radicals and up-regulation of PON2 expression by activating PPARγ and transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) [94].

4.3. Anticancer potential
Cancer is a terminal illness caused by abnormal cell growth which becomes uncontrollable over time [95]. Cancer is linked to about 9.8 million deaths worldwide which occur annually, making cancer the second leading cause of mortality in the world [33], [95]. Different studies were conducted on cancer to develop natural medicinal treatments, as such, several anti-cancerous medications such as taxane, vinca, alkaloids, podophyllotoxin, and other natural-based medications are based on different medicinal plants compounds [95]. The cytotoxicity of the pomegranate seed oils was tested using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)− 2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay against human lung cancer cell lines in comparison with colon cancer cell lines. The seed oil did not show anti-cancerous activity on the lung cancer cell lines (80.3 ± 1.2–25.4 ± 1.2%) and the colon cancer cell lines (83.3 ± 1.2–28.4 ± 1.2%) [33]. Furthermore, a study by Sun et al. [18], identified that fruit peel extracts contain anti-cancerous properties which interfere with the tumor cell proliferation. Another comparative study conducted by Aumeeruddy and Mahomoodally [95], tabled the fruit rinds, roots peels, and fruits extracts and reviewed their effectiveness on different cancer cells [95].

Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme is an inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase that enhances the generation of prostaglandin (PGE2) from arachidonic acid. Activated COX-2, thus bringing about the production of PGE2 and ultimately inflammation in response to proinflammatory stimuli (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) [71], [96]. COX-2 has been identified in several tissues and excessive expression has been noticed in the pathogenesis of colon cancer [97], lung cancer [98], skin and oesophageal cancer [99].

Several studies have indicated that pomegranate has a potential anti-tumorigenic or anti-cancer activity. Inhibition of COX-2 expression, cell proliferation, and cell growth have been examined. Jaganathan et al. [97], revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathways are associated with the expression of COX-2. Stimulation of PI3K induces phosphorylation of Akt which results in activation of NF-kB, ultimately leading to increased COX-2 expression in colon cancer. PI3K activation results in COX-2 expression and increased proliferation of the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29). Treatment with pomegranate juice inhibited NF-kB, Akt phosphorylation, and COX-2 expression. Also, pomegranate suppressed MAPK pathways (p38, ERK1, and JNK), thus leading to COX-2 expression inhibition (Fig. 15). Such brought about the anti-inflammation, decreased cell growth, as well as proliferation [97].

A study by Khan et al. [100], examined the inhibitory effect of pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) on the inflammation and proliferation attributed to exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in mouse skin. UVB exposure induced NF-kB activation, phosphorylation of MAPK, and increased expression of COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Oral PFE administration decreased COX-2 and iNOS expression. The PFE suppressed NF-kB activation, nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation of NF-kB at Ser by the I kappa B kinase complex (IKK α, β, γ). It prevented dissociation of NF-kB from I kappa B alpha (IkBα) through the suppression of phosphorylation, degradation of IkBα, and IKK activation. In addition, the authors revealed that consumption of PFE inhibited phosphorylation of MAPK pathways, the ERK, the JNK, and the p38 [100]. Interestingly, PFE treatment was also found to suppress human lung carcinoma A549 cells growth by inhibiting MAPK proteins phosphorylation, P13K, Akt phosphorylation, and NF-kB activation (Fig. 15) [101], [98]. Therefore, pomegranate can be used as a natural chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic in combating cancer. However, further studies are vital to confirm their safety and efficacy.

4.4. Antiviral and anti-COVID-19 potential
P. granatum contains alkaloids, polyphenols, and coumarins which are some of the chemical compounds associated with fighting viral replication and have virucidal effects [102]. Polyphenols are the dominant compounds in P. granatum plants and fruit. Polyphenols constitute 4 variant compounds namely caffeic acid, ellagic acid, luteolin, and punicalagin; they are responsible for the antiviral properties in P. granatum (G. J. [73], [75]). Haidari et al. [103], showed that these polyphenols can inhibit RNA viral replication by reducing the agglutination of red blood cells in chicks. Furthermore, in the study of [75], P. granatum has been used in the phage amplification assays as a viricidal agent. The ethanol peel extracts were found to be effective in reacting against the Mayaro virus in a dye uptake assay, with an (IC50 = 12.3 mg/kg) and the polyphenol variant, punicalagin contained an (IC50 = 28.2 mg/kg) demonstrating high levels of antiviral properties [83]. In a more recent study, hydroethanolic peel extract (70% ethanol) was investigated for its antiviral properties by conducting a qRT-PCR assay against a Human norovirus, The results revealed that hydroethanolic peel extract of P. granatum has significant antiviral activity against Human norovirus [41].

Additionally, several studies have been conducted to investigate the potential inhibitory activity of pomegranate against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan city, China. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 comprises four types of proteins viz. Envelop (E), Nucleocapsid (N), Membrane (M), and Spike (S) glycoprotein. Altogether, these viral proteins play a crucial function in the viral assembly and formation of viral particles. Among four proteins, S-protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds strongly to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, to enter cells and initiate infection [57], [48], [104].

The inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein (RBD) and ACE2 receptor interaction using pomegranate and or phytochemicals is promising in the prevention, alleviation, and treatment of COVID-19. For instance, a study by Suručić et al. [46], determined the potential inhibition of PPE polyphenols (gallic acid, punicalin, punicalagin, urolithin A, and ellagic acid) for SARS-CoV2 spike-glycoprotein and ACE2 receptor contact using in silico molecular dockings. The findings revealed that all the PPE compounds had significantly higher binding affinity ranges from − 6.86 to − 9.25 kcal/mol compared to positive control Umifenovir (−5.97 kcal/mol). Among all the tested PPE compounds, punicalin exhibited the strongest binding energy (−9.25 kcal/mol). The study concluded that PPE polyphenols could be used as natural inhibitors in the prevention or therapy of SARS-CoV-2 contagions [46].

Another current article by Tito et al. [105], examined the possible inhibition activity of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and PPE phenolic compounds against SARS-CoV-2 spike- glycoprotein and human ACE2 receptor interaction, and on the virus 3CL protease activity. The results of their study revealed that PPE (0.04–1 mg/mL) was most effective, it displayed the highest inhibitory activity (74%) for virus Spike and ACE receptor interaction compared to its polyphenols. PPE polyphenols, punicalagin (PC), ellagic acid (EA), and gallic acid (GA) inhibited 49%, 36%, and 0%, respectively. The Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) experiment was used to assess the binding capability and the results demonstrated that PPE bound strongly (10-fold) both with Spike and ACE2. Human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentivirus. Gene expression analysis results revealed that treating HK-2 infected cells with PPE (0.04 mg/mL) downregulated the expression of ACE2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) genes that aid the virus to infect the host cells. Besides, PPE (80%), PC (50%), and EA (10%) suppressed 3CL protease enzymatic activity responsible for SARS-COV2 replication, see Fig. 16. The authors concluded that PPE and its polyphenols are promising inhibitors to hinder SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding interaction, and hence virus infection and replication. However, further in vivo studies are needed to determine its safety and effectiveness [105].

4.5. Anti-malaria properties
Malaria is one of the most prevalent diseases in Africa caused by the parasite Plasmodium and it is responsible for causing severe immune complications and mortality [106]. Pomegranate studies to aid malaria for natural products treatment through medicinal plants have been conducted. For one, [23] conducted a review study and indicated that the cure for malaria can be aided by the pomegranate peel extract which has anti-malaria effects and it is effective against common malaria-causing parasites, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium falciparum. Additionally, a methanol pomegranate peel extract was active against Plasmodium chabaudi parasite in Swiss albino mice [84]. Similarly, Dkhil et al. [106]; Mubaraki et al., [85] also highlighted that methanol peel extracts were more effective against Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium chabaudi.

4.6. Anti-diabetic properties
The development of cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, and insulin resistance lead to cardiovascular diseases which destroy the functioning of organs systems and may cause immune dysfunction [107], [20]. Diabetes is an endocrine disorder that is caused by a lack of insulin and can result in chronic hyperglycemia [27]. Obesity is one of the leading causes of diabetes particularly type II diabetes [20]. According to Fourati et al. [44], obesity and an unhealthy diet are some of the factors which lead to the development of diabetes mellitus. Mayasankaravalli et al. [20], investigated the anti-diabetic properties of peel extract, an aqueous peel extract of the pomegranate fruit was found to be effective in inhibiting the chronic hyperglycemia oxidative stress which is linked to diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, antioxidants assays including DPPH and hydrogen peroxide showed increasing free radicals which are necessary for increasing normal metabolism to prevent hyperglycemia [20].

In one study by Ge et al. [3], it has been established that pomegranate flower extracts are capable to prevent the development of type II diabetes by reducing the blood glucose levels and in return inhibiting the alpha-glucosidase enzyme by increasing postprandial hyperglycemia in type II patients. With severe development of type II diabetes, diabetes nephropathy can develop and cause renal failure [27]. Methanol leave extracts of Punica granatum were investigated to treat diabetes nephropathy, which in return improved the lipid metabolism normalized serum albumin concentrations, and decreased hyperglycemia [27]. A similar study that investigated methanolic leave extracts on diabetic rats demonstrated that the methanol leave extract contained antioxidants that are antidiabetic and restored normal metabolic pathways [30].

A review study by Jandari et al. [108], examined the effects of pomegranate on the management of obesity by decreasing the risk of developing type II diabetes. The study explored the effects of Punica granatum on glycemic indices (blood glucose, insulin resistance, hemoglobin), anthropometric indices, blood lipids, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. The results demonstrated that pomegranate extracts had no significant effects on body weight and BMI, however, the antioxidants have been identified to have benefits in managing and reducing the risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, a study conducted by Bagri et al. [109], evaluated the antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant activities of aqueous pomegranate flower (PGF) extract on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The findings indicated that oral intake of PGF extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) elicited a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and very-low-density protein (VLDL). Also, PG induced a markedly increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), reduced glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide anion (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) [109].

A study by Tang et al. [110], examined the antidiabetic activity of PGF polyphenols extract in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Administration of PGF polyphenols extract (50–100 mg/kg) for about a month enhanced insulin sensitivity, attenuated FBG levels, TG, TC, HDL-C, and free fatty acids (FFA). PGF improved liver glycogen content, and antioxidant status (CAT, SOD, GPx), and reduced MDA levels. PGF mechanism of action is through the activation of the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) expression, thus leading to an increase in insulin sensitivity, see Fig. 17. Another mode of action, PGF improves insulin sensitivity by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling pathway (Fig. 17). ER stress stimulates the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), IRE1α, then the transformation of transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), leading to phosphorylation of IRS-1, and ultimately insulin resistance [110].

Abbreviations: PPARγ – peroxisome proliferator-activated transcriptional factor-alpha; TNF-α tumor necrosis factor; mRNA – messenger ribonucleic acid; NF-kB – nuclear factor kappa B; FBG – fasting blood glucose; TG- triglyceride; TC - total cholesterol; LDL-C - low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; NEFA - non-esterified fatty acid; ALT – alanine transaminase; AST – aspartate transaminase; IRS-1 - insulin receptor substrate 1; Akt – protein kinase B; GSK-3β – glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; ER - endoplasmic reticulum; UPR - unfolded protein response; IRE1 - inositol-requiring enzyme 1; IRE1α - inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha; XBP1 - -box binding protein 1; SOD -superoxide dismutase; CAT – catalase; GSH – glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; GR – glutathione reductase; GST – glutathione S-transferase; MDA – malondialdehyde; FFA - free fatty acids; HFD - high-fat diet; STZ -streptozotocin; CPT1 - carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1; ACO - acyl-CoA oxidase; ZDF – Zucker diabetic fatty. The figure was created using BioRender.com by the authors.

A study by Wu and Tian [111], explored the anti-obesity and -diabetic activities of PGF active compounds on α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase (Fig. 17). PGF isolated compounds including tricetin 4′− 0-β—glucopyranoside, tricetin, luteolin, ellagic acid, granatin B, gallic acid, punicalagin, apigenin, and luteolin-4′− 0-glucoside. Their results showed that all compounds had inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase. However, tricetin and ellagic acid were highly effective, both had more powerful inhibitory activity on α-glucosidase than acarbose the anti-diabetic drug. It is postulated that the hydroxyl groups found in the chemical structures of compounds may be responsible for the inhibitory activity [111]. Another study evaluated the activity of pomegranate (juice, seeds, flowers, and peels) on rat intestinal α-glucosidase and porcine pancreatic α-amylase. The methanol extract of PGF displayed a stronger inhibitory effect on both enzymes, while PPE only on α-glucosidase among others. In addition, pomegranate polyphenols such as ellagic acid and gallic acid both inhibited α-glucosidase [112]. In addition, a study by Huang et al. [113], examined the antidiabetic effect of PGF and its mechanism of action on glucose metabolism. Daily intake of methanol extract of pomegranate flower (500 mg/kg) suppressed an increase in glucose levels in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. PGF enhanced glucose metabolism and insulin sensitization by increasing the expression of cardiac PPARγ mRNA, and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) levels in ZDF rats. PGF stimulated the activity of lipoprotein in human TPH-1-differentiated macrophage cells. Also, their results revealed that the antidiabetic activity of PGF extract is caused by the presence of gallic acid (H mess uang et al., 2005).

4.7. Beneficial effect on gut microbiota
The human gastrointestinal tract especially the colon composed of trillion species of bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and archaea called the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining human health, immune system development, and metabolism [114], [115]. Several factors influence the composition of gut microbiota including antibiotics, western diet, genetics, and age [116]. The absence or shortage of probiotic bacteria has been associated with obesity [117], inflammation, and type 2 diabetes [118].

Intestine microflora can promote adipocytes' inflammation through the release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) resulting in increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Inflammation of adipose tissue is one of the major factors that contribute towards insulin resistance as well as diabetes mellitus [118]. Another mechanism that links gut microbiota with inflammation, obesity, and diabetes is the production of short-chain fatty acids. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are metabolites produced by microbial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates in the intestine. SCFAs play a significant role in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, fat metabolism, and energy metabolism. Also, SCFAs prevent inflammation. However, they can also contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes [119], [118], [117]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to clarify the association between gut microbiota, SCFAs, and human health [119], [120]. Reduced production of SCFAs or imbalanced gut bacteria can influence appetite or stimulate satiety via increasing secretion of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), leptin, and peptide YY (PYY). SCFAs induce fat accumulation via inhibition of adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMP) and reduction in hepatic fats oxidation. SCFAs might also elicit lipogenesis by suppressing fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) and inhibiting lipoprotein lipase [120], [119].

SCFAs cause activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPAR-alpha (α), and PPAR-gamma (γ). PPARα is overexpressed in the adipose tissue, heart, liver, kidneys, and stomach. It regulates the expression of genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (Pgc1α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), and the cluster of differentiation 36 (Cd36). Such play an important function in fatty acid oxidation or metabolism and energy homeostasis or glucose metabolism [121]. PPARγ is expressed mainly in the adipocytes, where it activates genes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, Cpt2; fatty acyl-CoA oxidase 1, Acox1; fatty acid-binding protein 4, Fabp4; and fatty acid synthase, Fatp1. The expression of these genes elicits lipogenesis and adipogenesis [121], [122]. PPARγ is also found in other tissues like the pancreas, muscles, and colon, and its function includes glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and anti-inflammation [121], [123].

It has been shown that pomegranate or its phytoconstituents can improve the gut microbial activity and concentration of SCFAs. For instance, Bialonska et al. [124], evaluated the effects of pomegranate by-product (POMx) and pomegranate ellagitannins (punicalagin) on the growth of intestine bacteria and formation of SCFAs using faecal matter collected from 3 healthy participants who did not consume antibiotics for at least 6 months. The results revealed that exposure to POMx increased the growth of total bacteria, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus species. Also, POMx increased the formation of SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate), see Fig. 17. Nevertheless, punicalagin did not show a significant effect on the growth of bacteria species and concentrations of SCFAs. The study suggested that the presence of ellagic acid, gallic acid, and glucose units in POMx oligomers may be contributed to the growth of probiotic bacteria [124].

A recent study by Song et al. [125], examined the effectiveness of pomegranate fruit pulp (PFP) on the gut microbiota and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Consumption of pomegranate fruit pulp (PFP) promoted weight loss in mice fed HFD compared to those without PFP supplements, but body weight was higher than in mice who received a low-fat diet (LFD). Mice fed HFD plus PFP showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum TG, TC, LDL-C, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels (Fig. 17). PFP increased insulin levels but had no significant effect on HDL-C. Also, PFP supplements inhibited adipogenesis compared to HFD-mice. In addition, the study found that PFP intake lowered the abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes, while the HFD intake was the other way around. The study concluded that changes in the intestine microbiome could be the mechanism through which PFP prevents obesity and related diseases [125].

4.8. Anti-obesity properties
Obesity is a metabolic disorder caused by several factors which include genetic makeup, dietary pattern, environmental factors, and lifestyle patterns [126]. Pomegranate molecular effects on obesity have been investigated in several studies. For one, research by Hontecillas et al. [127], measured the ability of pomegranate punicic acid (PUA) to activate PPAR α and γ. The results demonstrated that PUA can increase the expression of PPARα and PPARγ in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, however, PUA did not bind tightly on the human PPARγ ligand-binding domain. The study further examined the effect of dietary PUA in vivo on db/db mice and revealed that PUA supplements attenuated FBG levels and enhanced glucose-normalizing ability. Besides, PUA suppressed the expression of TNF-α mRNA and NF-kB activation in the liver, adipose, and plasma. Therefore, the absence of PPARγ results in hyperglycemia, diabetes, and inflammation (Fig. 17) [127].

Another research finding by Xu et al. [128], determined the efficacy of PGF on the liver of Zucker diabetic fatty and human hepatic (HepG2) cells. The treatment with PGF induced a reduction in liver weight, TG contents, and the formation of lipid droplets. The mode of action of PGF is by stimulating the activation of gene expression of PPARα, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1), and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), as well as decreased stearoyl-Coa desaturase expression (Fig. 17). In addition, treatment with PGF also upregulated mRNA expression associated with PPARα and ACO in the HepG2 cells. The study concluded that PGF can improve diabetes and obesity-associated fatty liver through the activation of hepatic gene expression regulating fatty acid oxidation [128].

4.9. Toxicological properties and antigenotoxic activity
Measuring the toxicity of plant extracts is important for determining the biological indicators for in vitro studies as many chemicals and plants have different levels of toxicity [129]. Furthermore, the lethal dosage for human consumption of pomegranate fruit was determined to be 830.2 mg/kg [32]. The toxicological effects of Punica granatum hydroethanolic peel extract with 87.5, 175 350, and 700 mg/kg of body weight (BW) dosage concentrations were investigated on different Swiss mice groups using micronucleus and toxicity assays. The findings showed that the peel extracts had no significant effect on the control species, suggesting the hydroethanolic peel extract could be used for phototherapeutic therapy against diseases that cause oxidative damage [86]. In another study that investigated the potential of cytotoxicity of P. granatum on livestock feed, the feed extracts contained peels, pericarps, and seeds. Extracts contained garlic acid (IC50 = 41.2 ± 19 µg/mL) and the phenolic constituent (punicalagin) with the IC50 (314.1 ± 110.7 µg/mL). Amongst all other compounds, punicalagin were found to be highly toxic at a concentration of 31 ± 12.7 μg/mL [14].

Mohamad Sukri et al. [79], assessed the cytotoxicity of peel extract with 7.81 – 250 μg/mL (IC50 = 96.35 μg/mL) concentration on colorectal cancer cells and normal colon cell lines. The pomegranate peel extracts exhibited a cytotoxicity effect on the cancerous cells at 31.25 µg/mL concentration and not on normal colon cell lines at all concentrations (7.81–250 µg/mL). Furthermore, a hydroethanolic peel extract was investigated for its genotoxic, toxicological, and antigenomic properties on Swiss mice. By conducting a subacute toxicity test and a micronucleus test, the P. granatum hydroethanolic peel extract micronucleus test indicated the LD50 at (700 mg/kg) and no significant impact on the mice [86]. The hydroethanol extract genotoxicity and toxicity lethal doses were determined to be at 731 mg/kg. The study by Vale et al. [86], further demonstrated the effects of the pomegranate extract at 350 mg/kg concentration. The study concluded that the hydroethanolic peel extract did not cause or have cytotoxic effects. Also, the ethanol seed extracts of the P. granatum were administered to the Wistar rats with (160 mg/kg) concentration at 0.8% concentration equivalence. The extract exhibited no lethal impact on the Wistar rats [32].

4.10. Hepatic anti-fibrotic effect
Hepatic or liver fibrosis is a condition depicted by the overproduction of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which brings about excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibrinogen [130]. Nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factors play important roles in antioxidant and inflammatory responses, and they are also implicated in the development of liver fibrosis [132], [131].

A study by [133], examined the antifibrogenic activity of pomegranate juice (PGJ) against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced hepatic fibrosis in mammalian (rats) model of liver fibrosis. DEN injection attenuated enzymatic antioxidant activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) by increasing the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). DEN impaired liver function by inducing excessive inflammation via increasing inflammatory responses and COX-2 expression levels. The study revealed that treatment with PGJ improved the activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, and reduced the elevated levels of malondialdehydes (MDA) via regulation of NF-kB and Nrf2 signaling pathways. Also, PGJ decreased the activities of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFα, and IL-6), chemokines, adhesion molecules, and COX-2 expression in the liver by downregulating the NF-kB signaling pathway [133]. The present study by [134], investigated the ameliorative effect of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic fibrosis in a rat model. The results demonstrated that the use of PPE restored antioxidant status by attenuating the concentration of MDA and increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) via activation of Nrf2. PPE decreased the expression levels of smooth muscle alpha-actin (α-SMA), collagen 1 alpha 2 (COL1A2), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins in liver tissues by suppressing phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK), Fig. 18 illustrates the process. The authors further explored whether the coadministration of PPE and Nrf2 inhibitors can alter the expression of p38 MAPK. Their results demonstrated that Nrf2 inhibitors did not modify the expression of p38 MAPK. Thus, the study has postulated that Nrf2 is downstream signaling in the p38 MAPK pathway [134].

4.11. Clinical studies
Medicinal plants contain large amounts of phytochemicals as natural products, which makes them receive a lot of attention in the area of drug discovery or development because they have minor side effects [135]. Therefore, clinical trials based on natural products such as medicinal plants are useful to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plants and to pave a way for relevant treatment discovery [136]. A review conducted by Eghbali et al. [42], indicated that P. granatum is a good source of bioactive compounds which can be used for new drugs formulation.

Several clinical studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of P. granatum as a natural product to develop drug delivery and formulation, which could be used to treat diabetes, endocrine disorders, rheumatic disorders, renal disorder, gastrointestinal disorders, dermatological disorders, and other neuropsychiatric disorders [42] and COVID-19 [46], [137]. A study by Baradaran Rahimi et al. [138] reviewed different clinical studies which focused on the effectiveness of P. granatum and ellagic acid on metabolic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cancer (prostate and colorectal), physical activity, hemodialysis, cognitive deficits, skin pigmentation, and sexual hormonal disorders. The study concluded that future research is needed to evaluate the protective effects of pomegranate and isolate the compound, ellagic acid.

A randomized double-blinded clinical study by Cortés‐Martín et al. [139], investigated the effect of pomegranate extract nutraceutical versus a placebo defect on patients with metabolic syndrome. The pomegranate-treated patient showed prebiotic effects, and the study concluded that the pomegranate extract nutraceutical can only be effective in patients with metabolic syndrome when coupled with daily provided hospital treatment [139].

Another randomized controlled clinical trial by Khajebishak et al. [140], investigated the effects of pomegranate seed oil in obese patients with diabetes mellitus. The study included 52 patients separated into two groups, one group was provided with placebo medication and the other group was provided with pomegranate seed oil (1 g). A significant difference in the control group was identified, with the patient’s gene expression (GLUT-4) increased and blood glucose decreased. The study concluded that pomegranate seed oil could be viable as a treatment for obese patients with type II diabetes [140].

Moreover, a recent randomized double-blinded drug development study for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by Goodarzi et al. [141], investigated the effectiveness of pomegranate fruit extracts in patients with NAFLD. Patients provided with the pomegranate fruit extract supplements indicated significant improvements and increased in their serum HDL-C, with no significant impact on serum LDL-C levels.

Additionally, a study by Abedini et al. [142], determined the efficacy of pomegranate juice for treating cardiovascular disease in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. By conducting a clinically randomized study, Abedini et al. [142], revealed that pomegranate juice is beneficial for blood pressure and serum concentration and can further increase serum LDL-C levels.

A different randomized triple-blinded study by Jacob et al. [143], compared the effects of pomegranate peel extracts against chlorhexidine on different dental bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus, and Veillonella). The pomegranate peel extract mouth wash was more effective against Streptococcus mutans and showed no significant impact on Lactobacillus and Veillonella.

Furthermore, a study performed by Adel-Mehraban et al. [144], explored the impact and the effectiveness of consuming pomegranate supplements in women who are experiencing menopausal symptoms. The placebo-controlled trial study concluded that the pomegranate fruit extracts supplements can reduce menopausal symptoms and increased the quality of life in women who are in the menopause stage [144].

4.12. Other potential effects
Pomegranate has been found to possess androgenic properties which were viable for treating male infertility ailments including improving sperm quality [15]. A study that reviewed nutritional and bioactive components of the pomegranate highlighted that the pomegranate peels or rinds can be used as food additives while their phenolic constituent, pectin, can be used as a coloring agent on food [145]. The pomegranate phenolic compounds were also demonstrated to have anti-aging properties and the different pomegranate phenolic compounds were able to improve memory [82], demonstrated anti-Alzheimer’s properties, and improved muscle functioning [38]. Furthermore, a pomegranate fruit pericarp extract was found to contain anti-biofilm formation properties and bio-compatibility properties [82].

5. Conclusion, recommendations, and future studies
Punica granatum L. or pomegranate is one of the most valuable medicinal plants for pharmacological, industrial, and commercially use including is an edible tree that also produces a few components including beverages, juices, food, such as jam, salad-based food, and additive in food coloring, cosmetic products including shampoo and bathing soaps amongst others. The global application and treatment of P. granatum are different across the globe. With its origin in the Mediterranean regions, the P. granatum is one of the ancient tree plants being used today for pharmacological, therapeutic, and medicinal properties. P. granatum has been used in treating cough, cold, ulcers, intestinal disorders, dandruff, and cardiovascular diseases. Increasing evidence has shown that P. granatum and its active compounds are promising in the amelioration, prevention, and treatment of cancer, virus, inflammation, obesity, diabetes, malaria, liver fibrosis, fungal infections, and bacterial infections. In recent times, the potential inhibition activity of pomegranate and or its polyphenols against or block SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein and ACE2 receptor interaction using in silico molecular docking studies have been studied for the treatment or prevention of COVID 19. However, future studies are needed to investigate their mechanism and well-designed large-scale randomized clinical studies to further determine the efficacy and safety of pomegranate or its compounds on COVID 19. Therefore, the application of in silico molecular docking studies can also be used as a tool to assess the pomegranate as an inhibitor of other diseases. To date, over 100 diversity of bioactive compounds such as punicalin, ellagic acid, phylligenin, secoisolariciresinol, pomegralignan, castalagin, castalin, and many others have been isolated from various parts of pomegranate (seeds, bark, peels, seeds) which are responsible for therapeutic properties of this plant. Nevertheless, only a few of these phytochemicals have been validated using clinical trials. In addition, pomegranate is an excellent source of antioxidants and nutrients (e.g., vitamin C) to protect against excessive free radical species that can be harmful to the body. Furthermore, research findings have revealed that pomegranate possesses the ability to mitigate, prevent, and cure numerous diseases or ailments via many different modes of action such as the regulation of Nrf, NF-kB, MAPK, COX-2, PPARs, and Akt signaling pathways. It enhances anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2. Also, antioxidant defense mechanism via SOD, CAT, GSH, and GST enzymatic activities. Therefore, there is a need for more scientific studies to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pomegranate or its phytochemicals in animals and humans. Also, research progress on the mechanisms of action is required for the development of sufficient natural drugs. In addition, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables including pomegranate can provide numerous health benefits such as reducing the risk of developing several chronic diseases.
