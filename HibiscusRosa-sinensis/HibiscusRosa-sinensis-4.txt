8 Benefits of Hibiscus Tea

Hibiscus tea is high in antioxidants and offers many benefits. In particular, it may help promote weight loss, reduce the growth of bacteria and cancer cells, and support the health of the heart and liver.

Hibiscus tea is an herbal tea that’s made by steeping parts of the hibiscus plant in boiling water.

It has a tart flavor similar to that of cranberries and can be enjoyed both hot and cold.

There are several hundred species of hibiscus varying by the location and climate they grow in, but Hibiscus sabdariffa is most commonly used to make hibiscus tea (1

Antioxidants are molecules that help protect against compounds called free radicals, which cause damage to your cells (2
Trusted Source
).

Hibiscus tea is rich in powerful antioxidants and may therefore help prevent damage and disease caused by the buildup of free radicals.

One study in people with Marfan syndrome, a disorder that affects connective tissue, found that an infusion with hibiscus extract reduced oxidative stress and increased antioxidant levels in the blood (3
Trusted Source
).

Another animals study had similar findings, showing that hibiscus extract helped protect against cell damage in rats (4
Trusted Source
).

However, keep in mind that these studies used concentrated doses of hibiscus extract rather than hibiscus tea. More studies are needed to determine how antioxidants in hibiscus tea may affect humans.

SUMMARY

Animal studies have found that hibiscus extract has antioxidant properties. Additional studies are needed to determine how this may translate to humans.

2. May help lower blood pressure

One of the most impressive and well-known benefits of hibiscus tea is that it may lower blood pressure.

Over time, high blood pressure can place extra strain on the heart and cause it to weaken. High blood pressure is also associated with an increased risk of heart disease (5
Trusted Source
).

Several studies have found that hibiscus tea may lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

In one study, 46 people with high blood pressure were given hibiscus tea or a placebo. After 1 month, those who drank hibiscus tea had a greater decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, compared to the placebo (6
Trusted Source
).

Similarly, a 2015 review of five studies found that hibiscus tea decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 7.58 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and 3.53 mmHg, respectively (7
Trusted Source
).

While hibiscus tea may be a safe and natural way to help lower blood pressure, it is not recommended for those taking medications used to treat high blood pressure, as it may interact with these drugs (8).

SUMMARY

Some studies have found that hibiscus tea may lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, it should not be taken with blood pressure medications to prevent an interaction.

3. May help lower blood fat

In addition to lowering blood pressure, some studies have found that hibiscus tea may help lower blood fat levels, which are another risk factor for heart disease (9
Trusted Source
).

In one 2009 study, 60 people with diabetes were given either hibiscus tea or black tea. After 1 month, those who drank hibiscus tea experienced increased levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and decreased levels of total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, and triglycerides (10
Trusted Source
).

Another older study in those with metabolic syndrome showed that taking 100 milligrams (mg) of hibiscus extract daily was associated with decreased total cholesterol and increased HDL (good) cholesterol (11
Trusted Source
).

Plus, a 2022 review found that hibiscus tea could reduce levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol more effectively than other types of tea and a placebo (12).

However, other studies have produced conflicting results regarding hibiscus tea’s effects on blood cholesterol.

In fact, a review of seven studies including 362 participants concluded that hibiscus tea did not significantly reduce total cholesterol or triglyceride levels (13
Trusted Source
).

Furthermore, most studies showing a benefit of hibiscus tea on blood fat levels have been limited to people with specific conditions like metabolic syndrome and diabetes.

More large-scale studies examining the effects of hibiscus tea on blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels are needed to determine its potential effects on the general population.

SUMMARY

Some studies have shown that hibiscus tea may reduce blood cholesterol and triglycerides in those with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. However, other studies have produced conflicting results. More research is needed in the general population.

4. May boost liver health

From producing proteins to secreting bile to breaking down fat, your liver is essential to your overall health (14
Trusted Source
).

Interestingly, studies have shown that hibiscus may promote liver health and help keep it working efficiently.

One 2014 study in 19 people with overweight found that taking hibiscus extract for 12 weeks improved liver steatosis. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver, which can lead to liver failure (15
Trusted Source
).

A study in hamsters also demonstrated the liver-protecting properties of hibiscus extract, showing that treatment with hibiscus extract decreased markers of liver damage (16
Trusted Source
).

Another 2022 animal study reported that hibiscus extract helped improve fatty liver disease in rats fed a high fat diet (17
Trusted Source
).

However, these studies all assessed the effects of hibiscus extract, rather than hibiscus tea. Further research is needed to know how hibiscus tea affects liver health in humans.

SUMMARY

Human and animal studies have found that hibiscus extract may benefit liver health by reducing liver damage and fatty liver.

5. Could promote weight loss

Several studies suggest that hibiscus tea may be associated with weight loss and could help protect against obesity.

One 2014 study gave 36 participants with overweight either hibiscus extract or a placebo. After 12 weeks, hibiscus extract reduced body weight, body fat, body mass index, and hip-to-waist ratio (15
Trusted Source
).

An animal study had similar findings, reporting that hibiscus extract could help reduce body weight and appetite by preventing the accumulation of fat cells (18
Trusted Source
).

Current research is limited to studies using concentrated doses of hibiscus extract. More studies are needed to determine how hibiscus tea may influence weight loss in humans.

SUMMARY

A few human and animal studies have associated the consumption of hibiscus extract with decreased body weight and body fat, but more research is needed.

6. Contains compounds that may help prevent cancer

Hibiscus is high in polyphenols, which are compounds that have been shown to possess powerful anti-cancer properties (19
Trusted Source
, 20
Trusted Source
).

Test-tube studies have found impressive results regarding the potential effects of hibiscus extract on cancer cells.

In one test-tube study, hibiscus extract impaired cell growth and reduced the invasiveness of mouth and plasma cell cancers (21
Trusted Source
).

Another test-tube study reported that hibiscus leaf extract prevented human prostate cancer cells from spreading (22
Trusted Source
).

Hibiscus extract and its components have also been shown to inhibit the growth of other types of cancer cells in test-tube studies, including breast, stomach, and skin cancer (23
Trusted Source
, 24
Trusted Source
, 25
Trusted Source
).

Keep in mind that these were test-tube studies using high amounts of hibiscus extract. Research in humans is needed to evaluate the effect of hibiscus tea on cancer.

SUMMARY

Test-tube studies have found that hibiscus extract reduces the growth and spread of several types of cancer cells. Human studies are needed to evaluate the effect of hibiscus tea.

7. Could help decrease the growth of bacteria

Bacteria are single-celled microorganisms that can cause a variety of infections, ranging from bronchitis to pneumonia to urinary tract infections.

In addition to having antioxidant and anti-cancer properties, some test-tube studies have found that hibiscus could help protect against bacterial infections.

In fact, one test-tube study found that hibiscus extract inhibited the activity of E. coli, a strain of bacteria that can cause symptoms like cramping, gas, and diarrhea (26
Trusted Source
).

Another test-tube study showed that the extract fought eight strains of bacteria and was as effective as some medications used to treat bacterial infections (27
Trusted Source
).

However, no human studies have looked at the antibacterial effects of hibiscus tea, so it is still unclear how these results may translate to humans.

SUMMARY

Test-tube studies have found that hibiscus extract could reduce the growth of certain strains of bacteria. More research is needed to determine how hibiscus tea may affect bacterial infections in humans.

8. Flavorful and easy to make

Aside from its multitude of possible health benefits, hibiscus tea is delicious and easy to prepare at home.

Simply add dried hibiscus flowers to a teapot and pour boiling water over them. Let it steep for 5 minutes, then strain, sweeten it if desired, and enjoy.

Hibiscus tea can be consumed hot or cold and has a tart taste similar to that of cranberries.

For this reason, it is often sweetened with honey or flavored with a squeeze of lime juice to balance the tartness.

Dried hibiscus can be purchased at your local health food store or online. Hibiscus tea is also available in pre-made tea bags, which can simply be steeped in hot water, removed, and enjoyed.

SUMMARY

Hibiscus tea can be made by steeping hibiscus flowers in boiling water for 5 minutes. It can be consumed hot or cold and has a tart taste that is often sweetened with honey or flavored with lime.

The bottom line

Hibiscus tea is a type of herbal tea associated with many health benefits.

It also has a delicious, tart flavor and can be made and enjoyed from the comfort of your own kitchen.

Animal and test-tube studies have indicated that hibiscus may aid weight loss, improve heart and liver health, and even help reduce the growth of cancer cells and bacteria.

However, most of the current research is limited to test-tube and animal studies using high amounts of hibiscus extract. More studies are needed to determine how these benefits may apply to humans who drink hibiscus tea.
