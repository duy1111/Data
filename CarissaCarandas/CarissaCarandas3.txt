Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Carissa carandas pubmed

Objective: This study was planned to provide pharmacological basis to the medicinal use of Carissa carandas in constipation and diarrhea.

Materials and methods: The crude extract of the leaves of Carissa carandas (Cc.Cr) was prepared in methanol and its fractionation was carried out with ethylacetate, petroleum ether and n-butanol. In-vivo studies were conducted on mice, while isolated rabbit jejunum and guinea-pig ileum preparations were used for the in-vitro experiments. The spasmogenic and spasmolytic responses of gut tissues were recorded using isotonic transducers coupled with PowerLab data acquisition system.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the crude extract of Carissa carandas possesses a gut-stimulatory effect mediated primarily through the activation of muscarinic and histaminergic receptors while its spasmolytic effect was mediated possibly through Ca(++) antagonist pathway. Thus, this study provides a clear evidence for the dual effectiveness of Carissa carandas in constipation and diarrhea, thus validating its medicinal use.
