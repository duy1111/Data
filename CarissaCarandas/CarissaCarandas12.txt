Traditional Uses, Pharmacological Action and Phytochemical Analysis of Carissa carandas Linn.:A Review

Introduction
Carissa carandas (C. carandas) is a perennial [1] flowerLng [2,3] and
shrub with strong thorns in pairs [4] belong to the dogbane family
Apocynaceae and found to be widely distributed throughout
subtropical and tropical region of Pakistan [4,5], India [4,6],
Bangladesh, Srilanka, Java, Malaysia, Myanmar and Nepal [4]. Нe
plant has been cultivated for hedging around home gardens to prevent
garden vegetables from damaging by animals [5,6] and also used as
ornamental due to its beautiful cherry-like fruits [6]. It is an evergreen
plant which is a hardy, droughttolerant plant that thrives well in a wide
range of soils. Its common name is Koromcha in Bangladesh and
Karanda in English. Its botanical name was recently changed to C.
congesta Wight (syn. C. carandas Auct formerly widely shown as C.
carandas L.) [7,8]. Starting from immemorial time; peoples
traditionally used herbs and plants to treat dLوٴerent human and
animals ailments. It has been studied that the ethanolic extract of the
C. carandas root has been reported for its histamine releasing activity
used to assess the intensity of snake poisoning [9]. Нe phytochemical
constituents in it had led to the isolation of several substances
including betulinic acid, oleanoic acid [5], β-sitosterol, lupeol, mixture
of cardenolides, carissone and carindone. Its fruits have been used as a
dietary supplement or medicinal food for centuries and are of
increasing importance to consumers [9].

olyphenols, terpenes, flavonoLds, alkaloids and various plant extracts
exert an antioxidant action, antL-LnflammatLon, anti-malaria and
others. Нere is evidence regarding an association between individuals
who have a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, and the decreased
risk of cardiovascular diseases due to its pharmacological activities
such as antioxidant, antiviral and certain types of cancer healing
properties [10]. However, traditionally used medicinal plants still await
such screening. On the other hand, the medicinal properties of plants
have also been investigated in the light of recent scLentLfic
advancements throughout the world, due to their potent
pharmacological properties, low toxicity and economic viability.
Nowadays, a great deal of eوٴort being expanded to find eوٴectLve and
valuable bioactive chemical constituents for the treatment of dLوٴerent
human ailments. НLs review gives good information on the traditional
uses, extraction methods, pharmacological uses and phytochemical
constituents of C. carandas Linn (Figure 1)

Carissa carandas description
Carissa carandas commonly known as karonda is an evergreen
deciduous plant, generally 2-4 m tall shrub of the dogbane family
Apocynaceae. Нe stem is rich in white latex and the branches contain
sharp spines. Flowers are small, measuring 3-5 cm in diameter, with
white colors. Нe fruit is a berry, which is formed in clusters of 3-10
fruits, with 5-1 hard angles curving upwards, glabrous with five to
seven wings, fibrous and woody. Нe fruit is globose to broad ovoid in
shape with many seeds. Young fruits are pinkish white and become red
to dark purple when ripe. Ripe fruit color varies from white, green and
pinkish red depending on the genotype. Seed 3-5 per fruit, blankish
brown, flat, elliptical and light in weight. Flowering starts in the month
of January- February and fruits mature in May-June. Fruits are
generally harvested at immature stage for vegetable purpose, fully
ripen fruits are consumed fresh or processed [11,12]. Нe leaves are
oblong and conical, 4-6 inch long and 2-3 inch wide, green on the top
and brown below. If the leaves or stems are injured, the white milky sap
is seen, which is characteristic of this group of plants. Flowers are white
or yellowish flowers are found in groups. Нe bark is smooth gray. Нe
bark is thick, soі and of red color from inside [13].
Traditional use of Carissa carandas Linn
Carissa carandas produces beautiful and attractive berry-sized fruits
that are commonly used as a condiment or additive to Indian pickles
and spices. C. carandas is edible and used as appetizer, and the fruit is
pickled before it gets ripened [14]. Ripe C. carandas fruit has pectin
and used for making pickle, jelly, jam, squash, syrup, tarts and chutney
[6,14], which has commercial value [6]. Нe unripe fruits have
astringent taste owning to rich in iron and vitamin C which has anti
In the traditional system, it is known to treat dLوٴerent human
ailments as an astringent, appetizer, antipyeretic in stomach disorders,
rheumatism, treat brain disease [7], anthelmintic, cardiotonic and
lowering blood pressure [1]. Нe stem part of plant is used to
strengthen tendons [2,3,14,17]. Fruits of C. carandas has been used to
treat various human ailments such as: colic, oedema, hepatomegaly,
splenomegaly, indigestion, cardiac diseases, amenorrhoea, and it is
useful in treating of brain anorexia disease [15,18]. It is also useful for
the treatment of fever [6,15,19], sour, acrid, appetite loss, antipyretic,
piles, and act as nervine to calm the nervous disorder and having antiscorbutic properties used to treat anemia [15]. Further, it has been
used in treatment of malaria, epilepsy, pain relief, myopathic spasms,
dog bite, cough, colds, itches and leprosy [19], skin infections [2,3,14]
female libido, intestinal worms, antimicrobial, antifungal [14,16], liver
dysfunction, to counteract the putrefaction of blood [6,8], rheumatoid
arthritis [18], biliousness, stomachache, diarrheal, anthelmintic and as
astringent, analgesic and antL-Lnflammator\. Its leaves are remedy for
fevers, diarrheal, earache, syphilitic pain [2,3,8] and snake-bite/
poisoning [20]. Нe root part of it has been used to improve digestion,
anthelmintic, antimicrobial [4,6], stomach disorder, intestinal worms,
scabies, diabetic, ulcer, pruitis [21] and also used to reduce high blood
pressure [19].
Extraction methods
НLs review is used to identify the good extraction techniques
practice that has been used by dLوٴerent investigators in order to
analysis pharmacological and phytochemical constituents of the
dLوٴerent parts of C. carandas plant and to give direction for future
work on this plant.
Нe pulverized leaves of the plant was extracted with dLوٴerent
solvents by dLوٴerent investigators using various extraction methods
such as: methanol [3,19,22], ethanol (80%) [4,7], ethanol (95%) [16],
ethanol and water (1:1) [12], cold aqueous [2,23], methanol (80%),
ethanol (70%) and ethyl acetate (80%) [2] in a soxhlet extractor
[3,7,16,22], maceration [2,4,12,23], shaker [19]. Нe leaves and fruit
part of the plant were extracted with water, chloroform, ethyl acetate in
shaker [15]. Нe coarse powder of the roots were extracted with
ethanol (50%), methanol [18], ethanol (95%), aqueous [18,24], pet
ether (60-80%), chloroform, ethyl acetate and ethanol [21] solvents in
maceration [18,24] and Soxhlet extractor [21,24]. Нe powdered fruits
and root of the plant were extracted with ethanol using Soxlet
apparatus [25]. Нe powdered fruit was extracted with methanol
[26-28], ethanol, n-hexane [9] using maceration [26,28] and Soxlet
apparatus [9,27]. Нe overall evaluation of this review shows that
alcohol (methanol and ethanol) extraction followed by aqueous is the
appropriate solvent for the extraction of root, leaf, and fruit of C.
carandas in order to get more phytochemical constituents which is
biologically active molecules using maceration with magnetic stirring
or shaking techniques. In general, polar solvents are more eوٴectLve in
the extraction of bioactive molecules from C. carandas Linn. A
convenient and frequently used procedure is sequential solvent
extraction. A first step, with dichloromethane, for example, will extract
flavonoLd aglycones and less polar material. A subsequent step with an
alcohol will extract flavonoLd glycosides and polar constituents.
Certain flavanone and chalcone glycosides are dLٹcult to dissolve in
methanol, ethanol, or alcohol-water mixtures. Flavanone solubility
depends on the pH of water-containing solutions. Flavan-3-ols
Anticonvulsant activity
In the study of anticonvulsant activity, the ethanolic extract of C.
carandas root in the interval of 100-400 mg/kg showed sLgnLficant
reduction on electrically and chemically induced seizures. But only 200
and 400 mg/kg of the extract conferred protection (25% and 50%,
respectively) on the mice. Нe same doses saved the animals under
investigation from pentylenetetrazole-induced tonic seizures and
sLgnLficantl\ delayed the onset of tonic seizures produced by
picrotoxin, and N-methyl-dl-aspartic acid [6].
Hepatoprotective HوٴHFt
Нe ethanolic extract of root was tested for its hepatoprotective
activity at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg against CCl4
, paracetamol and
ethanol- induced hepatotoxicity in rat by decreasing the activities of
serum marker enzymes, bilirubin, alkaline phosphate, total protein,
total cholesterol and lipid peroxidation and showed sLgnLficant
hepatoprotective activity. It also increased sLgnLficantl\ the levels of
uric acid, glutathione, super oxide dismutase, catalase, and protein in a
dose dependent manner that was confirmed by the decrease in the
total weight of the liver and histopathological examination. Нe
ethanol and aqueous extracts at a dose level of 100 mg/kg and 200
mg/kg produced sLgnLficant hepato-protection by decreasing serum
transaminase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and serum
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase), alkaline phosphate, bilirubin and
lipid peroxidation, while sLgnLficantl\ increased the levels of liver
glutathione, and serum protein [6,9,30].
Нe ethanol and aqueous extracts of roots was evaluated against
ethanol induced hepatotoxicity in rats for its hepatoprotective eوٴects.
Its liver function, serum lipid profile, levels of lipid peroxidation and
the activity of liver antioxidant enzyme glutathione were established at
a dose level of 100 and 200 mg/kg. Нe eوٴect of extract produced
sLgnLficant hepatoprotection by decreasing serum transaminase
bilirubin and lipid peroxidation, while it sLgnLficantl\ increased the
levels of liver glutathione and serum protein [24].
Antimicrobial activity
Нe pet ether and methanolic extracts of leaf and stem showed
better antibacterial activities against both gram positive and gramnegative bacteria. It indicates the presence of broad spectrum
antibiotic compounds [1]. Нe methanolic extract of C. carandas leaf
exhibited higher degree of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus
aureus, followed by ethyl acetate extract against Escherichia coli
compared to tetracycline which are responsible for cause of gut
infection, stomachache and diarrhea [2]. Нe root extract has been
used by tribal healers for antimicrobial purpose confirms the test [4,6].
Antiviral activity
Нe ethanolic extract of C. carandas fruits possess eوٴectLve antiviral
activity against polio virus HIV-1 at 6 μg/ml, sindbis virus at 3 μg/ml
and herpes simplex virus at 12 μg/ml [9].
Anti-diabetic activity
It was investigated that aqueous extract of C. carandas on alloxan
induced and normoglycemic Wister rats sLgnLficantl\ (p<0.05)
decreased the blood glucose levels of alloxan diabetic Wister rats at
doses interval of 500-1000 mg/kg at 4, 8 and 24 hrs. Furthermore, the
methanol extracts on alloxan induced diabetic rats sLgnLficantl\
lowered the elevated blood glucose levels at dose level of 400 mg/kg
orally aіer 24 hrs compared to diabetic control. НLs is due to the
presence of polyphenol and flavonoLd content of the extracts [6,31].
Further, it was evaluated that the methanol extract and its fractions
in alloxan induced diabetic rats showed anti-diabetic potential. Нe
investigators reported that the methanol extract and its ethyl acetate
soluble fraction have sLgnLficantl\ lowered the elevated blood glucose
levels at dose level of 400 mg/kg orally aіer 24 hrs, as compared to
diabetic control. Polyphenol content of methanol extract and its ethyl
acetate soluble fraction were found to be 15.8 ± 1.2 mg and 18.55 ±
0.34 mg (gallic acid equivalent/g extract), whereas, flavonoLd content
of both extracts were 2.92 ± 0.03 mg and 1.534 ± 0.30 mg (rutin
equivalent/g extract) respectively. Нe workers concluded that the
antidiabetic potential of ethyl acetate fraction over methanol extract is
due to its partial purLficatLon achieved by fractionation which resulted
in increase in degree of polymerization, and segregation of secondary
metabolites [32].
Analgesic, antL-Lnflammator\ and antipyretic activities Some
investigators reported that ethanol and aqueous extracts from C.
carandas roots against rodent models showed sLgnLficant analgesic,
antL-Lnflammator\ and antipyretic activities. Нe ethanol and aqueous
extracts from roots of the plant exhibited sLgnLficant (p<0.01)
analgesic, antL-Lnflammator\, and antipyretic activities at the doses of
100 and 200 mg/kg body weight. Нe workers observed highest
percentage of inhibition of abdominal constriction (72.67%) of ethanol
extracts of the plant at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight in analgesic
activity. Further, the ethanol and aqueous extracts of it reduced the
formation of edema induced by carrageenan aіer 2 hrs sLgnLficantl\
[6-8,23,24].
Нe methanol extract of C. carandas’s leaf showed antLLnflammator\ and anti-pyretic activities. Нe extract at the dose of 200
mg/kg body weight exhibited maximum inhibition of LnflammatLon,
i.e., 72.10%, 71.90% and 71.80% at the end of 3 hrs with histamine,
dextran and carrageenan induced rat paw edema respectively
compared to indomethacin standard drug. Нe anti-pyretic activity
was evaluated by Brewer’s yeast induced pyrexia in albino rats. Нe
extract at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg showed sLgnLficant antipyretic activity compared to paracetamol at dose 150 mg/kg [3]. Нe
percentage of inhibition was calculated by using formula,
