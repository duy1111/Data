Brassica juncea rugosa

Material uses
There is some evidence that if this plant is grown as a green manure it is effective in reducing soil-borne root rots in pea crops[6]. This is attributed to chemicals that are given off as the plants decay[6].
Medicinal uses(Warning!)
Reported to be anodyne, aperitif, diuretic, emetic, rubefacient, and stimulant, the plant is a folk remedy for arthritis, foot ache, lumbago, and rheumatism[16].
The seed is used in the treatment of tumours in China[16]. In Korea, the seeds are used in the treatment of abscesses, colds, lumbago, rheumatism, and stomach disorders[16]. The root is used as a galactagogue in Africa[16]. Ingestion may impart a body odour repellent to mosquitoes[16]. Mustard oil is used in the treatment of skin eruptions and ulcers[16]. Believed to be aperient and tonic, the volatile oil is used as a counterirritant and stimulant[16]. In Java the plant is used as an antisyphilitic emmenagogue[16]. Leaves applied to the forehead are said to relieve headache[16].

The Chinese eat the leaves in soups for bladder, inflammation or haemorrhage[16].

Cultivation
Succeeds in full sun in most well-drained moisture-retentive fertile soils[17][18][6]. Prefers a heavy soil and some shade[17]. Dislikes very hot weather[2]. Plants tolerate high rainfall and, although fairly deep rooted, are not very drought resistant[6].
A form of B. juncea that has been selected in the Orient for its large edible leaves, there are many named varieties[6]. Plants are very hardy and stand the winter well in temperate areas, they can be harvested lightly in the winter but the main cropping time is in spring[6]. Plants take 3 - 4 months to reach maturity[6]. They prefer a fairly high stable temperature and are well adapted to short day length[18]. Plants have a rooting depth of between 90 - 120 cm[16].

A good bee plant[13].
